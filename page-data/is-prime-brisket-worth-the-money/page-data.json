EVEN THOUGH THE BRISKET PRICE PER POUND IS RELATIVELY LOW - THE SHEER SIZE OF THE\nCUT IS WHAT MAKES THE PRICE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE.\nA lot of the actual price per pound of a particular brisket also revolves around supply and demand, like everything else. There\ncould be a cattle shortage, an increase in demand for beef, the list goes on. \n\nGenerally though in Texas - the Price per pound of prime grade brisket has never gone above $3.99. \n\nFor ‘lesser’ grades of brisket - it could be as low as $1.99 per pound for select and somewhere in between for choice grade\nbrisket.\n\nLet’s take an example of obtaining a giant, 20lb piece of brisket, and compare it against different prices for the different\ngrades I’ve seen:\n\nPrime Brisket Price:\n\n\n20lb X $3.99 = $79.80\n\n\n$79.80 for a 20lb piece of meat may sound like a lot, but it’s 20lbs of meat! That’s a lot of meat to consume. Brisket can be\ngreat for eating throughout the week - or perhaps cooking for a large event. Imagine trying to cook 20lbs of rib eye. That would\nbe tremendously more expensive than this.\n\nNot only do you get a great bang for your buck - but the entire 20lbs of meat is prime grade quality. You really can’t beat that.\n\nChoice Brisket Price:\n\n\n20lb X $2.99 = $59.80\n\n\n$59.80 for a 20lb piece of meat is certainly not bad either! Choice can be another great way to accommodate a large gathering or\nserve as the primary food for your entire week. The marbling isn’t as good as prime - but you can still save some extra money\nwhile consuming a very tasty piece of barbecue.\n\nSelect Brisket Price:\n\n\n20lb X $1.99 = $39.80\n\n\nCan you imagine getting roughly 20lbs of meat for only $39.80? That’s what you can get with Select Grade Brisket. That being said\n- with Select - you really have to consider that there’s probably a reason why it is so cheap. Generally, Select Grade Brisket is\na lot leaner than both choice and prime. That means it is a lot more prone to being dry, tough, and not as tender. \n\nStill though, any grade of brisket can come out great if you are an excellent pit master.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHICH IS BETTER FLAT OR POINT BRISKET?\nIT DEPENDS IF YOU LIKE EATING A FATTY OR LEAN PIECE OF MEAT. FOR BBQ DROPOUT - POINT BRISKET IS THE WAY TO GO. THE POINT OF THE\nBRISKET WILL LITERALLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.\nWhen you smoke your brisket - you will want to separate the point from the flat eventually. You do this when you are slicing - and\nthere’s even a whole technique to it. \n\nWhen deciding which to eat - or which is better - let’s take a look at the profile of each part of the brisket.\n\nFlat Part of the Brisket\n\nThe flat portion of the brisket is by far the leanest. It is also the most prone to the common pitfalls of smoking and slicing a\nbrisket - drying out. This is a very delicate part of the brisket, and it needs some special attention.\n\nDespite the special attention it may deserve - the taste and flavor profile can still be very rewarding. Most people seem to like\nleaner types of meat - and the flat part of the brisket can be a great option. It has the right amount of beefy flavor,\ntenderness, and leanness.\n\nPoint Part of the Brisket\n\nThe point portion of the brisket is my absolute favorite! The reasoning for this is simply because it’s like biting into the\njuiciest steak imaginable. The entire portion of the point part of the brisket just melts in your mouth - if it was cooked\ncorrectly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES A PRIME BRISKET COOK FASTER?\nI HAVE SEEN PRIME BRISKETS COOK FASTER THAN OTHER LESSER GRADES SUCH AS CHOICE AND SELECT. MY THEORY IS SIMPLY DUE TO THE FACT\nTHAT A PRIME BRISKET WILL GENERALLY HAVE MORE MARBLING - AND THEREFORE LESS CONNECTIVE TISSUE TO RENDER DOWN. THIS SIGNIFICANTLY\nSPEEDS UP THE COOK.\nWhen smoking a brisket you are rendering down all of the collagen and connective tissue inside the meat. That is why you may hear\na lot of people say you need to be pulling the brisket not only when the internal temperature is around 200 degrees AND it probes\ntender. That’s when the brisket is truly done.\n\nThis effect can be expedited with prime briskets.\n\nUsually what happens is a prime brisket has more overall marbling and fat content and perhaps not as much muscle or connective\ntissue to render down. Fat is a lot easier to render down than all of those really tough connective tissues!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBRISKET COOKING TOO FAST?\nBRISKET CAN COOK TOO FAST IF YOU HAVE IT WRAPPED, ARE COOKING IT TOO HOT, OR YOU ARE SMOKING WITH A QUALITY GRADE SUCH AS PRIME.\nIf your brisket does happen to find itself cooking too fast, there are a variety of things you could consider doing:\n\n * Decrease the smoker temps to help prolong the cook\n * Unwrap the brisket if it is wrapped \n * Place the brisket in a cooler or warming oven to prolong the holding and resting time\n\nOnce you have exhausted all of these options - you just have to accept your fate! \n\nHowever, is having a brisket really all that bad? Most of the time it smokes for 12 or more hours, but if you’re in a time crunch\nanyways - it’s not the end of the world.\n\nThey are all different. Every brisket is not the same and you have to learn how to adjust accordingly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPRIME VS CHOICE BRISKET?\nPRIME IS BETTER THAN CHOICE IF YOU WANT A WELL MARBLED, FATTIER, AND MORE TENDER CUT OF BRISKET. IF YOU WANT A SLIGHTLY MORE LEAN\nTYPE OF BRISKET THEN GRAB A CHOICE GRADE BRISKET.\nLike everything else in life - don’t trap yourself by dogma. Basically, you don’t always have to be getting the ‘best’ grade of\nbrisket out there. Lot’s of people will ONLY grab prime ‘just because’ and that’s not the way to do it. \n\nAs a pit master - use your head - are prime briskets REALLY all that good?\n\nYeah, they are really good. But sometimes people want something different - and that’s okay!\n\nALL THIS BEING SAID - LET’S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIME AND CHOICE BRISKET:\nPrime Brisket:\n\n * Much more marbling\n * More forgiving to cook (due to marbling)\n * Not as lean as choice or select\n * More expensive ($3.99/lb)\n\nChoice Brisket:\n\n * Not as much marbling as prime\n * Good balance between too fatty and too lean\n * Not as forgiving as prime when cooking (lack of marbling)\n * Less Expensive ($2.99lb)\n\nAs you can see - when you actually break down the data and stray away from being too abstract - there are very few differences\nbetween the two grades of brisket.\n\nIt really boils down to if you want to pay more for a more fattier type of brisket that can tolerate a little more beating in the\ncooking process. That’s it.\n\nSELECT BRISKET VS PRIME?\nSELECT BRISKET IS MORE LEAN THAN PRIME, WHILE PRIME BRISKET IS WAY MORE MARBLED.\nWhat really matters when deciding between the two is how skilled you are at maintaining consistent temperatures throughout the\ncooking process and if you want a leaner or fattier brisket.\n\nLET’S BREAK THIS ONE DOWN:\nSelect Brisket\n\n * Not as forgiving as choice or prime brisket (lack of marbling)\n * Cheaper than both choice and prime brisket ($1.99/lb)\n * A lot more lean than both choice and prime brisket\n * Requires more Pit Master Skill to cook properly (due to leanness)\n\nPrime Brisket\n\n * A lot more forgiving than select and choice grade brisket (more marbling)\n * More expensive than both select and choice ($3.99/lb)\n * Not as lean and is more tender than both select and choice\n * Does not require as much Pit Master skill to cook properly (due to marbling)\n\nWhat it boils down to regarding prime vs select brisket is the amount of skill you have in smoking a brisket. The select brisket\nis a lot more prone to drying out than prime brisket and therefore requires much more attention than a prime grade brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIS PRIME BRISKET WORTH THE MONEY - FINAL THOUGHTS:\nPrime brisket is worth the money if you have the budget to pay a little extra for an easier to cook piece of meat. Otherwise - go\nwith choice or select if you don’t have the budget but have the required pit master skills to properly cook a brisket.","twitterTitle":"Is prime brisket worth the money? | ABSOLUTELY ","twitterDescription":"PRIME BRISKET IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY.

That’s what you can get with Select Grade Brisket. That being said - with Select - you really have to consider that there’s probably a reason why it is so cheap. Generally, Select Grade Brisket is a lot leaner than both choice and prime. That means it is a lot more prone to being dry, tough, and not as tender. </p><p>Still though, any grade of brisket can come out great if you are an excellent pit master.</p><hr/><h2>Which is Better Flat or Point Brisket?</h2><h3>It depends if you like eating a fatty or lean piece of meat. For BBQ DROPOUT - point brisket is the way to go. The point of the brisket will literally melt in your mouth.</h3><p>When you smoke your brisket - you will want to separate the point from the flat eventually. You do this when you are slicing - and there’s even a whole technique to it. </p><p>When deciding which to eat - or which is better - let’s take a look at the profile of each part of the brisket.</p><p><strong>Flat Part of the Brisket</strong></p><p>The flat portion of the brisket is by far the leanest. It is also the most prone to the common pitfalls of smoking and slicing a brisket - drying out. This is a very delicate part of the brisket, and it needs some special attention.</p><p>Despite the special attention it may deserve - the taste and flavor profile can still be very rewarding. Most people seem to like leaner types of meat - and the flat part of the brisket can be a great option. It has the right amount of beefy flavor, tenderness, and leanness.</p><p><strong>Point Part of the Brisket</strong></p><p>The point portion of the brisket is my absolute favorite! The reasoning for this is simply because it’s like biting into the juiciest steak imaginable. The entire portion of the point part of the brisket just melts in your mouth - if it was cooked correctly.</p><hr/><h2>Does a Prime Brisket Cook Faster?</h2><h3>I have seen prime briskets cook faster than other lesser grades such as choice and select. My theory is simply due to the fact that a prime brisket will generally have more marbling - and therefore less connective tissue to render down. This significantly speeds up the cook.</h3><p>When smoking a brisket you are rendering down all of the collagen and connective tissue inside the meat. That is why you may hear a lot of people say you need to be pulling the brisket not only when the internal temperature is around 200 degrees AND it probes tender. That’s when the brisket is truly done.</p><p>This effect can be expedited with prime briskets.</p><p>Usually what happens is a prime brisket has more overall marbling and fat content and perhaps not as much muscle or connective tissue to render down. Fat is a lot easier to render down than all of those really tough connective tissues!</p><hr/><h2>Brisket Cooking Too Fast?</h2><h3>Brisket can cook too fast if you have it wrapped, are cooking it too hot, or you are smoking with a quality grade such as prime.</h3><p>If your brisket does happen to find itself  cooking too fast, there are a variety of things you could consider doing:</p><ul><li><strong>Decrease the smoker temps to help prolong the cook</strong></li><li><strong>Unwrap the brisket if it is wrapped</strong> </li><li><strong>Place the brisket in a cooler or warming oven to prolong the holding and resting time</strong></li></ul><p>Once you have exhausted all of these options - you just have to accept your fate! </p><p>However, is having a brisket really all that bad? Most of the time it smokes for 12 or more hours, but if you’re in a time crunch anyways - it’s not the end of the world.</p><p>They are all different. Every brisket is not the same and you have to learn how to adjust accordingly.</p><hr/><h2>Prime vs Choice Brisket?</h2><h3>Prime is better than choice if you want a well marbled, fattier, and more tender cut of brisket. If you want a slightly more lean type of brisket then grab a choice grade brisket.</h3><p>Like everything else in life - don’t trap yourself by dogma. Basically, you don’t always have to be getting the ‘best’ grade of brisket out there. Lot’s of people will ONLY grab prime ‘just because’ and that’s not the way to do it. </p><p>As a pit master - use your head - are prime briskets REALLY all that good?</p><p>Yeah, they are really good. But sometimes people want something different - and that’s okay!</p><h2>All this being said - let’s take a quick look at the differences between prime and choice brisket:</h2><p><strong>Prime Brisket:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Much more marbling</strong></li><li><strong>More forgiving to cook (due to marbling)</strong></li><li><strong>Not as lean as choice or select</strong></li><li><strong>More expensive ($3.99/lb)</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Choice Brisket:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Not as much marbling as prime</strong></li><li><strong>Good balance between too fatty and too lean</strong></li><li><strong>Not as forgiving as prime when cooking (lack of marbling)</strong></li><li><strong>Less Expensive ($2.99lb)</strong></li></ul><p>As you can see - when you actually break down the data and stray away from being too abstract - there are very few differences between the two grades of brisket.</p><p><strong>It really boils down to if you want to pay more for a more fattier type of brisket that can tolerate a little more beating in the cooking process. That’s it.</strong></p><h2>Select Brisket vs Prime?</h2><h3>Select brisket is more lean than prime, while prime brisket is way more marbled.</h3><p>What really matters when deciding between the two is how skilled you are at maintaining consistent temperatures throughout the cooking process and if you want a leaner or fattier brisket.</p><h2>Let’s break this one down:</h2><p><strong>Select Brisket</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Not as forgiving as choice or prime brisket (lack of marbling)</strong></li><li><strong>Cheaper than both choice and prime brisket ($1.99/lb)</strong></li><li><strong>A lot more lean than both choice and prime brisket</strong></li><li><strong>Requires more Pit Master Skill to cook properly (due to leanness)</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Prime Brisket</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A lot more forgiving than select and choice grade brisket (more marbling)</strong></li><li><strong>More expensive than both select and choice ($3.99/lb)</strong></li><li><strong>Not as lean and is more tender than both select and choice</strong></li><li><strong>Does not require as much Pit Master skill to cook properly (due to marbling)</strong></li></ul><p><strong>What it boils down to regarding prime vs select brisket is the amount of skill you have in smoking a brisket. The select brisket is a lot more prone to drying out than prime brisket and therefore requires much more attention than a prime grade brisket.</strong></p><hr/><h2>Is Prime Brisket worth the Money - Final Thoughts:</h2><p><strong>Prime brisket is worth the money if you have the budget to pay a little extra for an easier to cook piece of meat. Otherwise - go with choice or select if you don’t have the budget but have the required pit master skills to properly cook a brisket.</strong></p>"},"draftboxSettings":{"content":{"cta":{"showAfterPostContent":false},"subscribe":{"showAfterPostContent":true},"misc":{"loadComments":"Load Comments","share":"Share","minRead":"min read"}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"pathPrefix":""}},"prevPost":{"title":"Do you season the firebox on a smoker? | BBQ DROPOUT INSIGHT","excerpt":"YES, YOU WILL WANT TO SEASON THE FIREBOX ON A SMOKER.

Before you start applying oil and heat to seal the metal - you will want to begin\ncleaning all the ash and residual particles out of the inside of the firebox.\n\nIt’s worth taking a look at the YouTube video of BBQDROPOUT explaining his process on cleaning out the Offset Smoker Firebox. \n\nIn the video, it is very apparent how important it is to season and clean out your firebox for your smoker. To get started, you\nwill need two primary pieces of equipment:\n\n 1. Shovel to scoop all material out of the smoker firebox\n 2. Ash Bucket to capture all the material you are scooping out of the smoker firebox\n\nShovel to scoop all material out of the smoker firebox\n\nThis step is pretty easy. All you have to do is grab a shovel that is relatively short in length to allow for easy holding. Easy\nholding meaning - you can hold the shovel with one hand. This will allow you to position objects in the smoker firebox with one\nhand, while scooping them out with the shovel in the other hand. \n\nThis makes the process of cleaning the smoker firebox extremely easy and efficient!\n\nOpen the grates of your smoker firebox and take out any placement metal commonly used to hoist the wood on top of. Once all the\nmain metal and residual tools are out, you can simply start scraping all throughout the firebox. \n\nSometimes, there will be hard chunks that will be difficult to scrape out. Don’t be afraid to really hammer the metal - this thing\nis solid steel after all. \n\nAsh Bucket to Capture all the material you are scooping out of the smoker firebox\n\nOnce you have your handheld shovel and are scooping out all of the ash and burnt wood - make sure to have your ash bucket ready at\nthe bottom end of the firebox. That way you wont have to manually scoop and walk over to a nearby trash can. It’s all about\nefficiency. \n\nThe size and scope of your ash bucket can be any size you are comfortable with. I just got one from my local grocery store - HEB -\nand it is quite big.\n\nThis will allow for some amazing scooping of ash out of my Smoker Firebox!\n\nOnce you are about done scraping and scooping all the ash into your ash bucket - feel free to empty the bucket. Don’t get into the\nhabit of leaving it there. I’ve done that many times and before you know it - your ash bucket will start to rust! Definitely don’t\nwant that. \n\nAlso, if you have a habit of leaving your equipment out in the elements - especially when it is filled with ash and other left\nover material - rain will eventually come and you don’t want your ash bucket to become filled with ash and water. It is not a good\ncombination.\n\nIf you want an in-depth tutorial for how to clean an offset smoker:\n\nHOW TO CLEAN OFFSET SMOKER? Learn how to effectively clean an offset smoker!

Often times with barbecue, you will need to rest the\npiece of meat for just as long as the actual cook takes. For pork shoulder, that means resting it for roughly 8-12 hours. This\nsimply lets the internal temperatures stabilize, and for all of the moisture inside the meat to replenish. If you don’t let a pork\nshoulder rest after smoking - you will absolutely have a dry piece of meat. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG DO YOU LET A PORK SHOULDER REST AFTER SMOKING - TABLE OF CONTENTS:\n> Can you let a pork shoulder rest overnight?\n\nWhy does pulled pork take so long?\n\nWhat temperature should I rest pulled pork?\n\nHow long can you let a pork shoulder rest?\n\nCan pulled pork rest too long? \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN YOU LET A PORK SHOULDER REST OVERNIGHT?\nYou can certainly let a pork shoulder rest overnight. In fact, it is highly recommended. The reason why you would want to rest a\npork shoulder overnight is comprised of multiple points:\n\n * Time you started your cook\n * Length of Cook\n * How large the pork shoulder is\n * Method of storing the pork shoulder\n * Estimated Serving time\n\nThese are just some general high level points to keep in mind that factor into why you should let a pork shoulder rest overnight. \n\nLet’s dig into some of them.\n\nTIME YOU STARTED YOUR COOK\nWhen you start smoking your pork shoulder: \n\n> Are you starting in the wee-hours of the morning?\n\nAre you starting in the afternoon?\n\nStarting the cook in the evening?\n\n\nThe time that you start smoking your pork shoulder is one of the most important qualities of the cook, and directly determines\nwhen you will potentially have to serve the meat. \n\nRemember - these cooks last anywhere from 8-12 hours OR LONGER. \n\nIf you start smoking your pork shoulder in the wee-hours of the morning - let’s say about 5am - you could estimate that you will\nfinish at roughly 5-6pm in the evening, and that’s being generous. \n\nLet’s quickly factor that time frame into the other two sub categories.\n\nIf you are smoking a pork shoulder in the middle of the afternoon - expect to have the cook finish right at midnight. \n\nAnd if you’re starting the cook in the evening - well, you are going to be up all night long!\n\nWe’ve quickly covered the points of when you will potentially have to start your cook, and how long it can take. Now, let’s\nconsider how large of a pork shoulder you’re smoking.\n\nA pork shoulder generally weighs anywhere from 10-20lbs, and a general rule of thumb to follow regarding how to estimate cook time\nis to count 1 hour of cook time per pound of meat. That means for a 15lb pork shoulder smoked at the standard 225 degrees - could\ntake over 15 hours! That is a huge factor that directly impacts how long you will be smoking your meat and by default - how long\nyou will rest the pork shoulder. \n\nOnce you consider when you start your actual cooking and how much the pork shoulder weighs - consider how you will begin to rest\nit.\n\nFor starters, there are a variety of methods I like to use for storing barbecue, and I cover some of them here for brisket:\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? | BBQ DROPOUT’S TAKE Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being\nsaid, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too short a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you\nlet brisket rest the right way, you can rest assured that the results will be amazing e… BBQ DropoutThe principles are the same,\nand you want to either store your pork shoulder in a faux cambro (ice chest) or an oven with a warming feature. \n\nThis can help prolong your resting if you need to serve at a specific time, or if you just want to have a way to control the\nambient temperature - which let’s the internal temps of your pork shoulder come down nice and steady. Having your temps come down\nsteady is a good thing, since you don’t want a lot of random fluctuations affecting your meat that you can’t control.\n\nAlright, now we’ve covered all of that - let’s take a quick look at why a pork shoulder takes so long to smoke!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY DOES PULLED PORK TAKE SO LONG?\nPork shoulder can take a substantially longer amount of time to not only smoke/cook, but to rest. The reasoning behind this is\njust due to the sheer size of the meat. Not only that, but when you place it off the smoker - it is raging hot. All of that meat,\nprotein, fat, and moisture is moving around inside and will promptly dry out if you cut into it too soon. \n\nFurthermore, with larger cuts such as pork shoulder - you will encounter something known as “the stall”. This is where the\ninternal temperature hits around 150-17o degrees internal, staying at that exact measure for hours on end. There’s a whole science\nbehind why that happens, but for simplicities sake - just keep smoking the meat - it will eventually progress through this\nstalling phase. \n\nFor those interested - basically what happens is the meat starts to sweat and actually cools down the meat. This seemingly\nprolongs the cooking process to several more hours and can certainly frustrate people that are new to barbecuing. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT TEMPERATURE SHOULD I REST PULLED PORK?\nThe temperature you should rest pulled pork should be when the pork shoulder reaches above 200 degrees internal. That can be a\ngreat way to indicate when the cook should come to an end. Even though you pull your pork shoulder off the smoker - that’s only\nhalf the battle!\n\nRegarding the temperature on when you should rest and pull it apart - that is generally anywhere from 150-160 degrees internal. \n\nWhatever you do - DO NOT PULL THE PORK UNTIL IT HITS AT LEAST 160 DEGREES INTERNAL!\n\nIf you make the mistake of tearing apart your pork shoulder before the temperature stabilizes to around 150-160 degrees - you will\nbe certain to have an unfortunately dry amount of pulled pork.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG CAN YOU LET A PORK SHOULDER REST?\nThe recommended length of time to let a pork shoulder rest is between 8-12 hours. This should give it ample time to come down in\ninternal temperature.\n\nYou don’t want to rest a pork shoulder longer than that time frame. Any longer, and you will risk either drying out the meat or\nrendering it too cold to serve. If you are trying to just let it rest for the purpose of letting all the moisture settle down\ninside - then it’s alright if you let it rest a little longer than 12 hours. \n\nLetting the pork shoulder rest longer than 12 hours should mean to you that it is headed straight to the fridge - otherwise it\nwill not be able to be served appropriately. Once you place it in the fridge for further resting, feel free to heat it back up to\nthe desired internal temperature - then start serving it. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN PULLED PORK REST TOO LONG?\nIt sure can! \n\nCheck out this article where I cover how long is too long for resting pulled pork:\n\nCAN PULLED PORK REST TOO LONG? | NO LONGER THAN 12 HOURS! Every piece of meat can rest too long. Pulled pork can rest in the oven\nor ice chest for about 8-12 hours. Anything longer - and you will have too cold of meat to serve.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------…\nBBQ Dropout","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"how-long-do-you-let-a-pork-shoulder-rest-after-smoking/","updatedAt":"23 June 2021","publishedAt":"23 June 2021"}},"pageContext":{"postSeoSlug":"is-prime-brisket-worth-the-money/","prev":"do-you-season-the-firebox-on-a-smoker/","next":"how-long-do-you-let-a-pork-shoulder-rest-after-smoking/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["126537975","1898930737","1956324895","3147518746","333656818","3485313408"]}
