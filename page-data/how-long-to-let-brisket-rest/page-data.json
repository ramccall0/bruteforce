Pit-Masters do it quite frequently. \n\nIf you’re wondering generally speaking how long to rest a brisket - the answer is usually it depends. That’s why I try to use the\nball park estimate of 12 hours. Obviously, there are a lot more factors that go into determining whether you can let a brisket\nrest over night such as your method of wrapping and storage location.\n\nThe methods of storing a brisket overnight are usually one of two things:\n\n1. Placing the brisket inside an ice chest (Faux Cambro)\n\n2. Placing the Brisket inside of the oven/warmer\n\nThese two methods of storing a brisket overnight will help to sufficiently not only keep the brisket temps stable, but will allow\na steady decrease in temperature over a longer period of time. \n\nWhen considering holding the brisket overnight - just be sure to finish the cook at a decent time, and factor in a rough estimate\nof about 8-12 of rest time in one of those two placement methods. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG?\nDon’t worry about resting a brisket too long, especially if you put in the effort of storing it properly. Resting a brisket in the\nproper location is critical. Like mentioned above, storing a brisket in either an ice chest cooler or a warming oven can allow you\nto hold a brisket for substantially longer periods of time than you otherwise could.\n\nThat being said, you CAN rest a brisket too long if you don’t follow the above advice. Any piece of meat, no matter how raging hot\nit currently is - will go cold at some point. You don’t want that.\n\nThe reason you want to be placing your brisket in a storage area that provides insulation is to allow all of the juices and the\nmeat itself to come to a reasonable temperature. You don’t want rapid spikes in heat in either direction.

That being said, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too\nshort a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you let brisket rest the right way, you can rest\nassured that the results will be amazing every time you smoke one.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? - TABLE OF CONTENTS:\nHow long is too long to let a brisket rest?\n\nWhat Happens If You Let brisket rest too long?\n\nCan you rest a brisket for 6 hours?\n\nIs smoked brisket good the next day?\n\nIs brisket better the next day?\n\nWhat temperature do you slice brisket at?\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - HOW LONG IS TOO LONG TO LET A BRISKET REST?\nAs a rule of thumb, for larger cuts like brisket - you will want to rest it for a time period greater than 3 hours. A way to\nensure a properly rested brisket is to even try resting it for 8-12 hours. \n\nAnything less than 3 hours for a rested brisket will create the chance that you will get a dry piece of meat. You don’t want that.\n\nAll you have to do is simply place it in either a Faux Cambro (ice chest) or some kind of warmer oven. This will ensure proper\ninsulation, and will let the internal temperature of the brisket to come down steadily. \n\nSince brisket is just a giant piece of meat, you want to rest it just long enough (12 hours maximum) but not too long! Anything\npast 12 hours - and you should be questioning if you started the cook too long. \n\nIn other words, 12 hours for resting a brisket is more than sufficient to render all the moisture inside.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LET BRISKET REST TOO LONG?\nIf you let a brisket rest too long, it will become too cold to eat and you will have to reheat it. \n\nA good rule of thumb to follow for gauging the internal temperature of a brisket is to never let it go below 150 degree before\nserving. That is why if the brisket is rested for longer than the threshold of 12 hours - you will most likely experience a\nbrisket with a very low internal temperature.\n\nAside from having to potentially reheat a brisket that was rested for too long, there isn’t really any threat to the moisture or\ntenderness present within. It may actually be good to just rest it for as long as you possibly can, since resting for large\namounts of time can certainly help the moisture content steady out. Steadying out moisture just means the moisture inside the\nbrisket isn’t way too hot, so when you slice it - it won’t immediately just vaporize and cause your meat to dry out instantly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - CAN YOU REST A BRISKET FOR 6 HOURS?\nYes, resting a brisket for 6 hours is the preferred method from many experienced Pit-Masters. Anything less than resting a brisket\nfor 6 hours, and you run the chance of having it dry out. That would be terrible!\n\nActually, if you really want to protect yourself - try resting your brisket for almost 12 hours in the preferred methods of\nresting (Faux Cambro/Oven) and you can potentially get an even more moist and tender brisket.\n\nIn short, don’t worry much about letting your brisket rest for a period of 6 hours. Especially since that is my preferred time\nframe for resting all of my freshly smoked brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - IS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY?\nSmoked brisket can be a fantastic meal even though you cooked it the prior day. In fact, you will often find that the entire\nbrisket cooking process takes over a day anyways. \n\nBarbecue is one of the types of food where it can be very resilient. This means that not only does it take a lot of beating during\nthe actual cooking process, but a cut like brisket can taste amazing even though it is over 12-24 hours after the cooking process\nhas come to a halt.\n\nIf you want to make sure the brisket comes out great the next day - just make sure to let it come down in internal temperature\nproperly. This will preserve all of your moisture and basically make the meat taste great.\n\nCheck out this article where I dive a little deeper into how long to let a brisket rest:\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST | BBQ DROPOUT PRO TIPS Wondering how long to let a brisket rest? This post will cover that topic in\nquite some detail. For the most part, it is recommended to let a brisket rest at least 6-12 hours. That can be quite a lot of\ntime, but if you want a great, moist, and tender brisket that retains all of its’ moisture - that… BBQ Dropout\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - IS BRISKET BETTER THE NEXT DAY?\nWe’ve already covered whether a brisket can be good the next day. Now - can it be even better than what it would have been freshly\nsliced? \n\nPotentially!\n\nIf you’re considering eating the brisket the next day - like mentioned above - often times you will find that the cooking process\nalready takes over 24 hours anyways. However, if you’re just considering letting it come all the way down in internal\ntemperatures, refrigerating it, reheating, then serving - you can still get some amazing results than you would have otherwise. \n\nTo make brisket better the next day - make sure you slowly let it come down in temperature before refrigerating. Once in the\nfridge and you are ready to start eating the next day, make sure to slowly start rising the internal temperature to roughly 15o\ndegrees. This will ensure a great, warm, and moist brisket without losing much of it’s flavor. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - WHAT TEMPERATURE DO YOU SLICE BRISKET AT?\nSlicing the brisket is another very important topic. Regarding what temperature you slice one - Do not slice until the brisket\nhits about 150 degrees in internal temperature. that will help to ensure that you don’t lose any moisture, and the brisket will\nrespond accordingly.\n\nWhen you want to slice a brisket, just ensure that you take the appropriate measure to keep the internal temperature within that\nrange. If it goes below 150 degrees in internal temperature, you might have too cold of a brisket. If you try to cut the brisket\nabove that amount, then you may start to lose all of the moisture that you’ve worked so hard to preserve!","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"can-brisket-rest-too-long/","updatedAt":"23 June 2021","publishedAt":"22 June 2021"},"nextPost":{"title":"WHEN TO PULL BRISKET | IMPORTANT BBQ DROPOUT INFO","excerpt":"TL;DR:\n\nIn order to figure out when to pull a brisket off the smoker, there are a variety of questions that people tend to ask. They are\nnoted down below, but for reference - you essentially want to pull your brisket off the cooker right at around 200 degrees\ninternal. That is the objective measure by which you can can know when your brisket is done cooking. The second most important\nfactor in this equation is how long you let it rest. I’ve gone through many briskets that have probed properly at 200 degrees\ninternal, but were sliced way too soon and it ruined the whole thing. With that being said, I like to rest my briskets as long as\nI can tolerate it. That means the briskets I smoke are rested for over 12 hours.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHEN TO PULL BRISKET - GETTING STARTED:\nWHEN TO PULL BRISKET - BBQ DROPOUT HIMSELFTABLE OF CONTENTS:\nWhen to pull brisket off smoker?\n\nCan I pull brisket at 190?\n\nDoes brisket get more tender the longer you cook it?\n\nDo You Let brisket rest in foil?\n\nCan I pull a brisket at 200?\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHEN TO PULL BRISKET OFF SMOKER?\nThis is a highly debated topic, but I’ll give you a simple answer:\n\n> Pull the Brisket off at 200 degrees fahrenheit.\n\n\nThat is the first thing you should be considering when you pull a brisket off the smoker. That’s really all it takes to know when\nto pull a brisket off the smoker. \n\nOf course, you can get into meat thermometer placement, whether or not you should wrap the brisket, how to pull the brisket off\nthe smoker, etc. But from a simplicity sake, just stick your thermometer in one of the more thicker parts of the meat and pull it\nat 200 degrees. DONE.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN I PULL BRISKET AT 190?\nAbsolutely not! \n\nEvery meat is different, sure. However, in general - every brisket I have gone to the trouble of smoking and pulling off before it\never reaches 200 degrees internal simply came out way too tough and undercooked.\n\nPulling brisket at 190 degrees internal is one of the worst mistakes you can make when smoking a brisket. I remember cooking this\namazing looking brisket several years ago when I was first starting my barbecue career. It looked like it was cooked all the way\nthrough, but my patience was wearing thin and I just decided to try and pull the brisket at around 190 degrees. The brisket came\nout awful and way too tough to even eat.\n\nMoral of the story - just make sure to pull your brisket at 200 degrees internal as a rough estimate as to when it should be ready\nand you will for the most part be good to go.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES BRISKET GET MORE TENDER THE LONGER YOU COOK IT?\nActually, yes it does!\n\nObviously you don’t want to overcook a brisket - that can certainly happen - but the most important quality of smoking a brisket\nis to cook it all the way through. That basically means to cook it just at around 200 degrees internal like mentioned above, and\nto take a toothpick - or some other sharp elongated device - and to start probing around the piece of meat. This will check to\ntest whether or not your brisket is probe tender.\n\nProbing the meat all around as you cook it longer will ensure that all of the collagen has rendered down. This is why you always\nhear people go off and on about how the brisket should ‘probe like a stick of butter’.\n\nThere’s a whole science behind this process.\n\nThe longer the brisket has to cook all of the heavily compacted collagen inside, the better. When you think about it, a brisket is\njust a GIANT muscle. This muscle has all kinds of connective tissue that is VERY tough to cut through, let alone to try and eat!\n\nThat’s why it becomes somewhat counter-intuitive to cook a brisket, or really any traditional piece of barbecue for that matter,\nall the way past roughly 200 degrees internal.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDO YOU LET BRISKET REST IN FOIL?\nYou certainly could! \n\nPersonally, I find it best to rest a smoked brisket that’s hot off the smoker in either an ice cooler or the oven. These are\nbetter ways to ensure that no heat will escape quickly. Furthermore, if you were to just transfer your foil wrapped brisket onto\nanother surface, you run the risk of the internal temp increasing way above what you wanted.\n\n Basically, letting a brisket rest in foil can serve to preserve the brisket’s internal temperature - but you run the risk of\nhaving it overcook way to quickly then losing all of the heat. Kind of a weird combo.\n\nBy placing it in an ice cooler or an oven, you get the best of both worlds. The temperature usually does not increase - meaning no\nrisk of over cooking it - and the brisket will gradually come down in temps. It won’t come down way to quickly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN I PULL A BRISKET AT 200?\nThis is what we’ve all been waiting for… YES!\n\nIf you haven’t noticed, i’ve been mentioning that you definitely will want to smoke your brisket all the way to 200 degrees\ninternal before pulling it.\n\nNot only do you want to pull a brisket at 200, but you also are going to want to start to begin resting the thing. That’s one of\nthe single most important qualities of a smoked brisket. \n\n> LET YOUR BRISKET REST AFTER YOU PULL IT!\n\n\nI have gone through many many many briskets where I frankly just cut into them WAY too soon and the end product was just very\nlackluster. One day, I smoked and pulled my brisket at 200 degrees internal and decided to let it rest for over 12 hours in an ice\ncooler. When it was finally sliced, the brisket was one of the most juicy briskets I had ever smoked. \n\nEver since then, that has lead me - the BBQ DROPOUT - to understand just how important it really is to properly pull and rest a\nfreshly smoked brisket.","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"when-to-pull-brisket-off-smoker/","updatedAt":"21 June 2021","publishedAt":"21 June 2021"}},"pageContext":{"postSeoSlug":"how-long-to-let-brisket-rest/","prev":"can-brisket-rest-too-long/","next":"when-to-pull-brisket-off-smoker/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["126537975","1898930737","1956324895","3147518746","333656818","3485313408"]}
