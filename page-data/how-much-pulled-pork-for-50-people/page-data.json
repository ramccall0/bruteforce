If you want to buy a Costco Picanha, you are in luck! In this post\nwe’ll be discussing some high level points regarding all things Picanha at Costco.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOSTCO PICANHA - TABLE OF CONTENTS:\n> Does Costco sell Picanha?\n\nCostco Picanha Price?\n\nWhere can I find Picanha meat?\n\nIs Picanha a good cut?\n\nWhy is Picanha not popular?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES COSTCO SELL PICANHA?\nCostco definitely sells Picanha. If you are looking to buy one, you need to go to the meat section. Take a look in the bins, and\nexamine the contents. You will find all kinds of cryo-vacuumed sealed bags with tons of meat in them.\n\nThey come in packages of around two to three actual Picanha’s per bag. The price per pound for prime Picanha at Costco is roughly\n$6.69/lb. That can be a great bargain when shopping for some awesome meat.\n\nHere’s a picture of what they look like:\n\nPicanha at Costco - Top Sirloin CapThe only downside to buying a Picanha at Costco is that the Picanha Cuts you get in these\nvacuumed sealed bags is actually just the meat itself - with the fat cap removed!\n\nIf you want a Picanha with a great, juicy fat cap on top - you will need to head on over to the meat counter and promptly ask one\nof the meat butchers to provide you with the following: \n\n> Sirloin cap steak with the fat cap on\n\n\nThis will indicate to them that you want a Picanha with the fat cap still in tact. Personally, I LOVE having the fat cap on my\nPicanha’s.\n\nIf you DON’T want the fat cap on your Picanha when shopping at Costco - then you can just go back to the meat bins and pick up:\n\n> Beef Loin Top Sirloin Cap \n\n\nThis one will just be the Picanha without the fat cap in tact.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOSTCO PICANHA PRICE?\nPicanha at Costco comes in a variety of prices, determined primarily through the grade you are selecting. \n\nHere’s a list of Prices for Picanha when buying it at Costco:\n\nGrade of PicanhaPrice Per lbChoice$6.29/lbPrime$6.69/lbHere’s a couple pictures of each of the different grades of Picanha at\nCostco:\n\nPicanha at Costco - Choice and Prime Grade\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE CAN I FIND PICANHA MEAT?\nSince we’re talking about buying Picanha at Costco - all you need to do is head over to either the meat counter and ask the\nbutcher for a cut, or to walk over to the meat bin with the sealed bags. \n\nIf you don’t have a Costco nearby - don’t worry. Just follow the same process as mentioned above at your local grocery store and\ntry to see if they have availability.\n\nOne of the things I’ve noticed about buying Picanha at Costco and other grocery stores - you generally have to ask multiple people\nin order to find someone who actually knows what you’re talking about.\n\n> Can you ask this in store or do you need to order ahead?\n\n\nYou don’t need to call ahead - generally speaking - since Picanha is really not that well known anyways. Therefore, since there\nisn’t that much competition for getting that particular cut of meat - you can usually just show up and pick one up on the spot.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIS PICANHA A GOOD CUT?\nPicanha is an amazing cut of meat. It’s a traditionally selected form of serving meat in Brazil - and is better known by the\npreparation method. Specifically, it is served Churrascaria style. \n\nFor more information on what the different Picanha Cuts are:\n\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PICANHA CUTS? What are the different Picanha Cuts? There are three main Picanha Cuts. Individual Picanha\nSteaks, Picanha Roast, and Brazilian Churrascaria. BBQ DropoutWhen buying the Picanha Cut at Costco - it can come out amazingly\nwell. That is due to the fact that most of the meat you will find in Costco is tenderized, and has excellent marbling quality. \n\nThe marbling quality is simply a result of the grades you are selecting. Prime and Choice grade Picanha at Costco is among the\nmost popular types you will find.\n\nSince the Picanha at Costco doesn’t have a fat cap - some people claim that you don’t need one anyways just because of the\nexcellent quality of the meat with regards to the marbling. \n\nSpeaking of marbling, check this out:\n\nPicanha Costco - MarblingPersonally, I am of the opinion that when buying one at Costco - you will want to get one with the fat\ncap still in tact!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY IS PICANHA NOT POPULAR?\nPicanha is not that popular because it is traditionally a Brazilian style of preparing meat. That means since it’s a foreign cut\nof meat - not that many people in the States will actually know what it even is. \n\nThe one’s that do know what Picanah is are generally those who either frequent one of the many Brazilian steakhouses around the\nU.S. or they are barbecue connoisseur’s much like myself! \n\nWant to learn more about Picanha?
