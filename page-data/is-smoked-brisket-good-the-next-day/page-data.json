Throughout this post, BBQ DROPOUT will\ndiscuss 4 different questions a lot of people seem to ask regarding slicing a brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n> what temp to slice brisket after resting\n\nShould you slice leftover brisket?\n\nCan you slice brisket cold?\n\nCan you slice brisket the next day?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT TEMP TO SLICE BRISKET AFTER RESTING?\nWHEN YOU ARE SLICING BRISKET - MAKE SURE TO ONLY SLICE INTO IT WHEN IT IS TEMPING OUT AT AROUND 150 - 170 DEGREES INTERNAL.\nANYTHING HIGHER THAN 170 DEGREES, AND YOU RISK HAVING ALL THE MOISTURE DRAIN AND DRY YOUR BRISKET OUT.\nWhen you think about it, slicing a brisket is a very critical part of the overall cooking process. You go through the effort of\nprepping your pit, seasoning the meat, and smoking the thing for well over 12 hours. \n\nLittle do some people know - that if you don’t heed the advice I just laid out - slicing in the temperature range of 150 - 170\ndegrees internal - you will make all of that incredible effort go to waste. \n\nThat is why you need to become better informed on how a brisket can react to certain stimuli. Stimuli in this case meaning slicing\nthe brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSHOULD YOU SLICE LEFTOVER BRISKET?\nYOU SHOULD IDEALLY SLICE THE BRISKET ONLY WHEN NEEDED. IF THE BRISKET IS TO BE SERVED ALL AT ONCE, THEN YOU SHOULD SLICE AS YOU\nARE SERVING. IF YOU HAVE INTENTIONS ON SECONDS - THEN YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WAIT TO SLICE THE BRISKET.\nBrisket is such a finicky piece of meat when it comes to serving. It is very prone to drying out, which is why it is touted as one\nof the hardest cuts of barbecue to get just right.\n\nDon’t worry though - just follow along in all of my posts and you will have great brisket every time!\n\nWhen you are ready to begin slicing your brisket - like mentioned above - you need to slice only when necessary. You don’t need to\nslice the whole thing at once. That means when you are finished smoking and resting the brisket - ask yourself when you need to\neat it?\n\nIf you can wait to eat it and need to slice at a later time, that’s completely fine. \n\nIf you are wanting to eat perhaps a small portion of the brisket - then you will want to try to only begin slicing the brisket\nareas that you intend to actually eat on the spot. Everything else can stay in tact. Again, this can be crucial to making sure all\nleft overs are adequately taken care of and you don’t get a nasty and dry piece of meat.\n\nNot only will it be dry and dull - but you will be very frustrated with a lackluster product despite spending 12 hours or more\ncooking it. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN YOU SLICE BRISKET COLD?\nYOU CAN SLICE BRISKET COLD. BE AWARE THOUGH, THAT IF YOU DO THIS AND ATTEMPT TO REHEAT THE SLICES INDIVIDUALLY - YOU ARE GREATLY\nINCREASING THE CHANCES THE SLICES WILL COME OUT DRY. IF YOU CHOOSE NOT SLICE THE BRISKET PIECES COLD - AND INSTEAD ONLY CUT INTO\nYOUR BRISKET WHEN YOU’RE READY TO SERVE RIGHT THEN AND THERE - THEN YOU WILL MOST LIKELY END UP WITH AN AMAZING END PRODUCT.\nUsually, when smoking a brisket and deciding to either rest it down to a reasonable internal temperature for serving - or putting\nit in the fridge for slicing cold and serving later - the option to only slice the brisket when necessary is the better option.\n\nSliced brisket, when left uneaten will dry out almost immediately. That is again why you will commonly hear pit masters say that\nwhen you do actually slice your brisket - to keep all the slices still compacted together so the juices and moisture doesn’t\nevaporate away. \n\nIf you don’t follow that advice, rest assured you will end up with a distasteful brisket slice. \n\nAll this to say - you certainly can slice a brisket cold if you so wish, and here’s how to do it and make sure that you’re slices\ndon’t dry out:\n\n * Slice the brisket cold and hold the individual slices inside a pan of the juices left over from the cook. Basically - the best\n   way to hold brisket slices is to hold them in what’s known as an jus. You can think of it as the brisket’s beef broth. It keeps\n   it moist, tender, and ensures a great flavor throughout. This will also make sure that whenever you decide to serve these slice\n   - they will be dripping all over!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN YOU SLICE BRISKET THE NEXT DAY?\nYou can slice brisket the next day. Make sure that the internal temperature is roughly around 150 degrees. This will ensure a\ngreat, warm, and tender product.\n\nYou need to be asking yourself what your overall goal is if you were to slice the brisket the next day. Also - you should be\nasking yourself what the current situation is that makes you consider such a question.\n\nWhen you smoke a brisket - depending how hot you decide to cook it at - you will find that the entire process takes at least 12\nhours no matter what you do. The process of cooking usually takes that time alone - plus any amount of resting you do. My\nrecommendation is to rest a brisket as long as humanly possible, just to ensure all moisture content has come to a halt\ntemperature wise. You do this to prevent any from evaporating when the meat is way too hot and you slice into it.\n\nAll of this being considered - you may very likely find yourself in the position to begin slicing the brisket the next day. That’s\ncompletely fine, just make sure you are resting it appropriately. \n\nWhen decide to slice the brisket the next day - if you take the appropriate resting methods to heart AND you pulled it off the\nsmoker at the right time (internal temps around 200 while probing tender), you will rest assured that your brisket slices are\ngoing to come out amazing. \n\nUpon slicing your brisket the next day - make sure that each slice is still compacted together - meaning don’t start handing them\nout until necessary and make sure to keep all slices sitting together. This helps to ensure that the moisture doesn’t evaporate\nand dry each of them out.","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"what-temp-to-slice-brisket/","updatedAt":"02 July 2021","publishedAt":"23 June 2021"},"nextPost":{"title":"Can brisket rest too long? | BBQ DROPOUT'S TAKE","excerpt":"Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being said, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too\nshort a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you let brisket rest the right way, you can rest\nassured that the results will be amazing every time you smoke one.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? - TABLE OF CONTENTS:\nHow long is too long to let a brisket rest?\n\nWhat Happens If You Let brisket rest too long?\n\nCan you rest a brisket for 6 hours?\n\nIs smoked brisket good the next day?\n\nIs brisket better the next day?\n\nWhat temperature do you slice brisket at?\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - HOW LONG IS TOO LONG TO LET A BRISKET REST?\nAs a rule of thumb, for larger cuts like brisket - you will want to rest it for a time period greater than 3 hours. A way to\nensure a properly rested brisket is to even try resting it for 8-12 hours. \n\nAnything less than 3 hours for a rested brisket will create the chance that you will get a dry piece of meat. You don’t want that.\n\nAll you have to do is simply place it in either a Faux Cambro (ice chest) or some kind of warmer oven. This will ensure proper\ninsulation, and will let the internal temperature of the brisket to come down steadily. \n\nSince brisket is just a giant piece of meat, you want to rest it just long enough (12 hours maximum) but not too long! Anything\npast 12 hours - and you should be questioning if you started the cook too long. \n\nIn other words, 12 hours for resting a brisket is more than sufficient to render all the moisture inside.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LET BRISKET REST TOO LONG?\nIf you let a brisket rest too long, it will become too cold to eat and you will have to reheat it. \n\nA good rule of thumb to follow for gauging the internal temperature of a brisket is to never let it go below 150 degree before\nserving. That is why if the brisket is rested for longer than the threshold of 12 hours - you will most likely experience a\nbrisket with a very low internal temperature.\n\nAside from having to potentially reheat a brisket that was rested for too long, there isn’t really any threat to the moisture or\ntenderness present within. It may actually be good to just rest it for as long as you possibly can, since resting for large\namounts of time can certainly help the moisture content steady out. Steadying out moisture just means the moisture inside the\nbrisket isn’t way too hot, so when you slice it - it won’t immediately just vaporize and cause your meat to dry out instantly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - CAN YOU REST A BRISKET FOR 6 HOURS?\nYes, resting a brisket for 6 hours is the preferred method from many experienced Pit-Masters. Anything less than resting a brisket\nfor 6 hours, and you run the chance of having it dry out. That would be terrible!\n\nActually, if you really want to protect yourself - try resting your brisket for almost 12 hours in the preferred methods of\nresting (Faux Cambro/Oven) and you can potentially get an even more moist and tender brisket.\n\nIn short, don’t worry much about letting your brisket rest for a period of 6 hours. Especially since that is my preferred time\nframe for resting all of my freshly smoked brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - IS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY?\nSmoked brisket can be a fantastic meal even though you cooked it the prior day. In fact, you will often find that the entire\nbrisket cooking process takes over a day anyways. \n\nBarbecue is one of the types of food where it can be very resilient. This means that not only does it take a lot of beating during\nthe actual cooking process, but a cut like brisket can taste amazing even though it is over 12-24 hours after the cooking process\nhas come to a halt.\n\nIf you want to make sure the brisket comes out great the next day - just make sure to let it come down in internal temperature\nproperly. This will preserve all of your moisture and basically make the meat taste great.\n\nCheck out this article where I dive a little deeper into how long to let a brisket rest:\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST | BBQ DROPOUT PRO TIPS Wondering how long to let a brisket rest? This post will cover that topic in\nquite some detail. For the most part, it is recommended to let a brisket rest at least 6-12 hours. That can be quite a lot of\ntime, but if you want a great, moist, and tender brisket that retains all of its’ moisture - that… BBQ Dropout\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - IS BRISKET BETTER THE NEXT DAY?\nWe’ve already covered whether a brisket can be good the next day. Now - can it be even better than what it would have been freshly\nsliced? \n\nPotentially!\n\nIf you’re considering eating the brisket the next day - like mentioned above - often times you will find that the cooking process\nalready takes over 24 hours anyways. However, if you’re just considering letting it come all the way down in internal\ntemperatures, refrigerating it, reheating, then serving - you can still get some amazing results than you would have otherwise. \n\nTo make brisket better the next day - make sure you slowly let it come down in temperature before refrigerating. Once in the\nfridge and you are ready to start eating the next day, make sure to slowly start rising the internal temperature to roughly 15o\ndegrees. This will ensure a great, warm, and moist brisket without losing much of it’s flavor. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - WHAT TEMPERATURE DO YOU SLICE BRISKET AT?\nSlicing the brisket is another very important topic. Regarding what temperature you slice one - Do not slice until the brisket\nhits about 150 degrees in internal temperature. that will help to ensure that you don’t lose any moisture, and the brisket will\nrespond accordingly.\n\nWhen you want to slice a brisket, just ensure that you take the appropriate measure to keep the internal temperature within that\nrange. If it goes below 150 degrees in internal temperature, you might have too cold of a brisket. If you try to cut the brisket\nabove that amount, then you may start to lose all of the moisture that you’ve worked so hard to preserve!","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"can-brisket-rest-too-long/","updatedAt":"23 June 2021","publishedAt":"22 June 2021"}},"pageContext":{"postSeoSlug":"is-smoked-brisket-good-the-next-day/","prev":"what-temp-to-slice-brisket/","next":"can-brisket-rest-too-long/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["126537975","1898930737","1956324895","3147518746","333656818","3485313408"]}
