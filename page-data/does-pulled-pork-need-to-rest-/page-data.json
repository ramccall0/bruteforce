OR WARMING OVEN. THIS WILL ENSURE THE\nINTERNAL TEMPERATURE IS HELD STABLE.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n> Pork shoulder resting period\n\nCan you put warm pulled pork in the fridge?\n\nCan I overcook pork shoulder?\n\nHow do you not overcook pork shoulder?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPORK SHOULDER RESTING PERIOD\nTHE RESTING PERIOD FOR PORK SHOULDER IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN 3-12 HOURS. THIS DEPENDS HOW LARGE THE CUT IS IN WEIGHT AND THE STORAGE\nMETHOD OF RESTING. IF A PORK SHOULDER IS PUSHING AROUND 20 LBS, EXPECT TO HAVE IT REST CLOSER TO THE 8-12 HOUR MARK. A PORK\nSHOULDER WEIGH IN AROUND 10 LBS, SHOULD ONLY REALLY REST ABOUT 3-8 HOURS.\nRegarding the storage method that you could use for resting your pork shoulder after smoking or cooking it refers to placing it in\neither an ice chest or warming oven. Not only that, but you should be considering wrapping your pork shoulder to further retain\nthe ambient and internal temperature within the meat. \n\nYou would want to do this if you really want to let the meat rest for an extended period of time. \n\nFor example, if you were wanting to perhaps serve it the next day - this can be a great option to still let the meat come down\nover a longer period of time. Basically just a technique commonly used by experienced pit-masters.\n\nIn terms of the average cook, you will still want to take the right precautions and ALWAYS rest it in either one of those to\npreferred storage methods.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN YOU PUT WARM PULLED PORK IN THE FRIDGE?\nYOU CAN CERTAINLY PUT WARM PULLED PORK IN THE FRIDGE. ALTHOUGH, IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO PUT FRESH OFF THE SMOKER AND VERY HOT\nPULLED PORK IN THE FRIDGE. YOU DON’T WANT EVERYTHING ELSE INSIDE TO WARM UP AND SPOIL.\nWhen you pull your pulled pork shoulder off of the smoker, you don’t want to get ahead of yourself and take the wrong steps in\nhandling the post smoke process. \n\nPulling your pulled pork off the smoker means you are ready to begin resting it. This can certainly be done in an ice\nchest/warming oven like mentioned above, and you can even rest it long term in the fridge. The only caveat to this is, you will\nwant to let the pork shoulder rest at least 3 hours before even thinking about putting it in the fridge. Again, you don’t want the\nambient temperature inside the fridge to start rising and spoil all of the perishables inside.\n\nThe overall goal of resting an amazingly smoked pork shoulder is to let the internal temperatures come down to a reasonable level.\nThis is around 150-170. Some pork shoulders get to that quicker than others, and is mainly dependent on how you store them after\nyou smoke in addition to how large the cut of meat is.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN I OVERCOOK PORK SHOULDER?\nYOU CAN CERTAINLY OVERCOOK A PORK SHOULDER. THIS USUALLY OCCURS WHEN YOU LET THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE RISE ABOVE 205 DEGREES\nINTERNAL. YOU CAN ALSO DRY OUT A PULLED PORK SHOULDER BY PULLING IT BEFORE THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE HAS HAD AMPLE TIME TO STEAD\nOUT AT AROUND 150-170 DEGREES.\nGenerally, there are two ways to discern whether or not if your pork shoulder is overcooked or undercooked:\n\n 1. Over Cooked: 1. Pork shoulder pulls apart easily, but the strands are tough and stringy.\n    \n    \n 2. Under Cooked: 1. Pork shoulder will be a really tough piece of meat that you can’t seem to pull apart.\n    \n    \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU NOT OVERCOOK A PORK SHOULDER?\nNOT OVERCOOKING A PORK SHOULDER IS EASY. SIMPLY MONITOR THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURES BEFORE PULLING OFF THE SMOKER - WHEN IT HITS\n200-203 INTERNAL AND PROBES LIKE BUTTER - THEN LET IT REST FOR AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF TIME - 3-12 HOURS IN MOST CASES - AND ONLY PULL\nTHE MEAT APART WHEN THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE REACHES BETWEEN 150-170 DEGREES.\nWhat seems to make people confused and unsure about their meats being smoked it usually due to the fact that they are either\nimpatient, or aren’t measure their temperatures appropriately.\n\nBeing impatient: \n\nWhen Pit-Masters go through the trouble of smoking their pork shoulder, I have seen many mess up at the last minute and simply\npull the meat way too quick. They usually think that since it has already been over 12 hours since the start of the cook, are\ngetting tired, are getting hungry, etc. that means they can just pull the thing off the smoker grates.\n\nWRONG!\n\nThe last couple of miles in the cooking process are absolutely critical to ensuring an amazingly smoked pork shoulder. \n\nBy being too impatient - you are sacrificing your entire smoke and basically wasting your time and hard work. You DON’T want that!\n\nNot measuring the internal temperature correctly:\n\nThis is a huge topic, but essentially you just want to be using the right kind of temperature reading equipment. Get a quality\nthermometer, stick it inside the thickest part of your pork shoulder, then let it start reading the temps.\n\nOnce you’re able to get a good read on the internal temperature for your pork shoulder - be sure to pull it at roughly 200-203\ndegrees internal. Do NOT pull the meat before this stage. Some people will say that the meat can possibly be done in the low\n190’s, however I have yet to see that myself. \n\nWhen the temperature hits the famed 200-203 range, that is precisely when the collagen within the meat will begin to dissolve and\nmake the inside incredibly tender. \n\nThat’s why when you not only have the internal temperature reading at 200 degrees, many experienced pit-masters will also advise\n(myself included) to begin probing the meat with the thermometer to see if it’s like butter.","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"pulled-pork-rest-overnight/","updatedAt":"28 June 2021","publishedAt":"23 June 2021"},"nextPost":{"title":"Can pulled pork rest too long? | NO LONGER THAN 12 HOURS!","excerpt":"Every piece of meat can rest too long. Pulled pork can rest in the oven or ice chest for about 8-12 hours. Anything longer - and\nyou will have too cold of meat to serve.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN PULLED PORK REST TOO LONG? - TABLE OF CONTENTS:\n> What do I do if my pork shoulder is done early?\n\nHow long can I hold pork butt in oven?\n\nCan I pull pork after it cools?\n\nHow do you keep a pork shoulder warm without drying it out?\n\nIs Pulled Pork better the next day?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT DO I DO IF MY PORK SHOULDER IS DONE EARLY?\nYOU NEED TO TAKE THE PORK SHOULDER OFF THE SMOKER, AND PLACE IT IN EITHER A WARMING OVEN OR ICE CHEST COOLER.\nWhen you place your barbecue in either an ice chest or warming oven, you help to prolong the amount of time that it is holding\nwarm. If your concern is that it is done too early, this can be a great method. It allows you to stop worrying about when your\npork shoulder is finished, and how you can effectively serve it. \n\nUsually, if a pork shoulder is done too early, you can be rest assured that by placing it in one of those two storage methods, it\ncan safely sit in there for 8-12 hours. This alone opens up a lot of possibilities for other cooks, as now you can start planning\nyour cooks better. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG CAN I HOLD PORK BUTT IN OVEN?\nYOU CAN HOLD PORK BUTT IN AN OVEN FOR ROUGHLY 8-12 HOURS. THIS WILL KEEP THE AMBIENT AND INTERNAL TEMPERATURES STEADY.\nWhen choosing to hold your pork butt in an oven, you can have a clean and effective way to make sure your barbecue comes out\nsimply amazing. It’s also recommended to wrap the pork butt in either foil or butcher paper to ensure the temperature will hold\neven longer. You don’t have to wrap it, since the oven can hold the ambient temperatures just fine - it’s just a pit-master pro\ntip if you really want to start holding it for longer periods of time.\n\nYou also want to pay close attention to how large the city of pork butt is. \n\nIf it’s one of those monster 20lbs pork butts, then expect to let it rest in the oven closer to the end of the 12 hour resting\nrange.\n\nIf the pork butt is hovering around 9-10lbs, then you don’t really have to let it rest for over 12 hours (although you certainly\ncould). My recommendation: let it rest for 3-6 hours in the oven.\n\nTable showcasing pork butt weight correlated with resting time in oven:\n\nPork Butt WeightResting time10lbs3-6 hours20lbs6-12 hours\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN I PULL PORK AFTER IT COOLS?\nYOU WANT TO PULL PORK WHEN IT COOLS. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT NO MOISTURE IS LOST AFTER THE COOKING PERIOD. MAKE SURE THE INTERNAL\nTEMPERATURE IS BETWEEN 150 - 160 DEGREES.\nWhen you let a pork rest and the internal temperature comes down to between 150-160 degrees internal, the end product will be\nawesome. \n\nOne of the worst mistakes you can make when smoking a pork shoulder is pulling it way too soon. Doing so will ruin your cook and\nthe meat will be completely dry. You won’t be able to eat it. Therefore, it is always recommended to do the following:\n\n 1. Pull Pork Shoulder Off Smoker\n 2. Place in storage container - ice chest/warming oven\n 3. Let rest until 150 - 160 degrees internal\n 4. Pull/shred pork shoulder after if cools\n\nIf for some reason you decide to let the pork shoulder rest inside a refrigerator - you probably won’t want to try to shred/pull\nit after it has cooled way down. All of the fat inside and around the meat itself at that point has solidified and you will be\nhard pressed to try and shred everything.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU KEEP A PORK SHOULDER WARM WITHOUT DRYING IT OUT?\nTO KEEP A PORK SHOULDER WARM WITHOUT DRYING IT OUT YOU WILL WANT TO PULL IT OFF THE SMOKER, WRAP IT IN FOIL/BUTCHER PAPER, THEN\nPLACE IT IN EITHER A WARMING OVEN. DO NOT INCREASE ANY AMBIENT TEMPERATURES, AND LET THE PORK SHOULDER REST. YOU WILL BE FINE\nLEAVING IT FOR UP TO 12 HOURS.\n> Is it OK to leave it covered in the oven at around 150 all day?\n\n\nAbsolutely. By letting a pork shoulder sit in a warming oven all day at an ambient temp of around 150 degrees - you are keeping\nthe environment hot enough to never let the pork shoulder go cold, but low enough to let the hot internal temperature come down to\na more reasonable amount. Usually, if you follow the above advice - you will never have a tough or dry pork shoulder. \n\nOne word of caution when storing your pork shoulder - it is absolutely critical to ensure that you pull the meat off the smoker at\nthe right temps! \n\nWhen in doubt, follow these steps:\n\n 1. Pull Pork shoulder off the pit at around 200 - 204 degrees internal 1. Make sure it is PROBE TENDER before pulling off the\n        smoker racks\n    \n    \n 2. Place it in a pan\n 3. Wrap in foil or butcher paper\n 4. Place in storage container - ice cooler or warming oven\n 5. Wait roughly 8-12 hours to let the internal temps come down \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIS PULLED PORK BETTER THE NEXT DAY?\nPULLED PORK CAN BE BETTER THE NEXT DAY. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TO ENSURE IT COMES OUT JUST AS GOOD FRESH.\nPULL THE PORK SHOULDER AT 200 DEGREES INTERNAL, AND LET IT REST FOR A LONG ENOUGH TIME OF 8-12 HOURS. WHEN YOU REHEAT THE PULLED\nPORK THE NEXT DAY - IT WILL TASTE AMAZING AND BE INCREDIBLY TENDER.\nIf you have a large gathering on a certain day - and are inquiring about whether you can time the smoking of your pork shoulder\nahead of time - you certainly can. \n\nAll you need to do is budget when your company is coming over. From that point, budget roughly another 24 hours to account for\ntotal smoking and resting time for your pork shoulder.\n\nWhen serving pulled pork the next day - you have two options:\n\n 1. Plan ahead, not refrigerate, and hold the pork shoulder in an ice chest/warming oven for 12 hours before serving.\n 2. Take an extra couple steps, and simply place the pork shoulder in the fridge, then appropriately reheat it a few hours before\n    your company arrives.\n\nDoing either of these methods will ensure that your pork shoulder will be very moist, tender, and tasty. That is all that matters.\n\nIf you are wondering how this applies to brisket, read here:\n\nIS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY? | YES Smoked brisket is amazing when served the next day. In order to make this happen, make\nsure you pull the brisket off the smoker at the right temps - 200 degrees internal, place it in the right storage container - ice\nchest or warming oven, and let it rest for no longer than 12 hours. ------------… BBQ Dropout","customExcerpt":"\n","postSeoSlug":"can-pulled-pork-rest-too-long/","updatedAt":"26 June 2021","publishedAt":"23 June 2021"}},"pageContext":{"postSeoSlug":"does-pulled-pork-need-to-rest-/","prev":"pulled-pork-rest-overnight/","next":"can-pulled-pork-rest-too-long/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["126537975","1898930737","1956324895","3147518746","333656818","3485313408"]}
