TAKE","metaDescription":"Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being said, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too\nshort a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you let brisket rest the right way, you can rest\nassured that the results will be amazing every time you smoke one.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? - TABLE OF CONTENTS:\nHow long is too long to let a brisket rest?\n\nWhat Happens If You Let brisket rest too long?\n\nCan you rest a brisket for 6 hours?\n\nIs smoked brisket good the next day?\n\nIs brisket better the next day?\n\nWhat temperature do you slice brisket at?\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - HOW LONG IS TOO LONG TO LET A BRISKET REST?\nAs a rule of thumb, for larger cuts like brisket - you will want to rest it for a time period greater than 3 hours. A way to\nensure a properly rested brisket is to even try resting it for 8-12 hours. \n\nAnything less than 3 hours for a rested brisket will create the chance that you will get a dry piece of meat. You don’t want that.\n\nAll you have to do is simply place it in either a Faux Cambro (ice chest) or some kind of warmer oven. This will ensure proper\ninsulation, and will let the internal temperature of the brisket to come down steadily. \n\nSince brisket is just a giant piece of meat, you want to rest it just long enough (12 hours maximum) but not too long! Anything\npast 12 hours - and you should be questioning if you started the cook too long. \n\nIn other words, 12 hours for resting a brisket is more than sufficient to render all the moisture inside.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LET BRISKET REST TOO LONG?\nIf you let a brisket rest too long, it will become too cold to eat and you will have to reheat it. \n\nA good rule of thumb to follow for gauging the internal temperature of a brisket is to never let it go below 150 degree before\nserving. That is why if the brisket is rested for longer than the threshold of 12 hours - you will most likely experience a\nbrisket with a very low internal temperature.\n\nAside from having to potentially reheat a brisket that was rested for too long, there isn’t really any threat to the moisture or\ntenderness present within. It may actually be good to just rest it for as long as you possibly can, since resting for large\namounts of time can certainly help the moisture content steady out. Steadying out moisture just means the moisture inside the\nbrisket isn’t way too hot, so when you slice it - it won’t immediately just vaporize and cause your meat to dry out instantly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - CAN YOU REST A BRISKET FOR 6 HOURS?\nYes, resting a brisket for 6 hours is the preferred method from many experienced Pit-Masters. Anything less than resting a brisket\nfor 6 hours, and you run the chance of having it dry out. That would be terrible!\n\nActually, if you really want to protect yourself - try resting your brisket for almost 12 hours in the preferred methods of\nresting (Faux Cambro/Oven) and you can potentially get an even more moist and tender brisket.\n\nIn short, don’t worry much about letting your brisket rest for a period of 6 hours. Especially since that is my preferred time\nframe for resting all of my freshly smoked brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - IS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY?\nSmoked brisket can be a fantastic meal even though you cooked it the prior day. In fact, you will often find that the entire\nbrisket cooking process takes over a day anyways. \n\nBarbecue is one of the types of food where it can be very resilient. This means that not only does it take a lot of beating during\nthe actual cooking process, but a cut like brisket can taste amazing even though it is over 12-24 hours after the cooking process\nhas come to a halt.\n\nIf you want to make sure the brisket comes out great the next day - just make sure to let it come down in internal temperature\nproperly. This will preserve all of your moisture and basically make the meat taste great.\n\nCheck out this article where I dive a little deeper into how long to let a brisket rest:\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST | BBQ DROPOUT PRO TIPS Wondering how long to let a brisket rest? This post will cover that topic in\nquite some detail. For the most part, it is recommended to let a brisket rest at least 6-12 hours.

Now - can it be even better than what it would have been freshly\nsliced? \n\nPotentially!\n\nIf you’re considering eating the brisket the next day - like mentioned above - often times you will find that the cooking process\nalready takes over 24 hours anyways. However, if you’re just considering letting it come all the way down in internal\ntemperatures, refrigerating it, reheating, then serving - you can still get some amazing results than you would have otherwise. \n\nTo make brisket better the next day - make sure you slowly let it come down in temperature before refrigerating. Once in the\nfridge and you are ready to start eating the next day, make sure to slowly start rising the internal temperature to roughly 15o\ndegrees. This will ensure a great, warm, and moist brisket without losing much of it’s flavor. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - WHAT TEMPERATURE DO YOU SLICE BRISKET AT?\nSlicing the brisket is another very important topic. Regarding what temperature you slice one - Do not slice until the brisket\nhits about 150 degrees in internal temperature. that will help to ensure that you don’t lose any moisture, and the brisket will\nrespond accordingly.\n\nWhen you want to slice a brisket, just ensure that you take the appropriate measure to keep the internal temperature within that\nrange. If it goes below 150 degrees in internal temperature, you might have too cold of a brisket. If you try to cut the brisket\nabove that amount, then you may start to lose all of the moisture that you’ve worked so hard to preserve!","postSeoTitle":"Can brisket rest too long? | BBQ DROPOUT'S TAKE","canonicalUrl":"","ogTitle":"Can brisket rest too long? | BBQ DROPOUT'S TAKE","ogDescription":"Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat.

A way to\nensure a properly rested brisket is to even try resting it for 8-12 hours. \n\nAnything less than 3 hours for a rested brisket will create the chance that you will get a dry piece of meat. You don’t want that.\n\nAll you have to do is simply place it in either a Faux Cambro (ice chest) or some kind of warmer oven. This will ensure proper\ninsulation, and will let the internal temperature of the brisket to come down steadily. \n\nSince brisket is just a giant piece of meat, you want to rest it just long enough (12 hours maximum) but not too long! Anything\npast 12 hours - and you should be questioning if you started the cook too long. \n\nIn other words, 12 hours for resting a brisket is more than sufficient to render all the moisture inside.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LET BRISKET REST TOO LONG?\nIf you let a brisket rest too long, it will become too cold to eat and you will have to reheat it. \n\nA good rule of thumb to follow for gauging the internal temperature of a brisket is to never let it go below 150 degree before\nserving. That is why if the brisket is rested for longer than the threshold of 12 hours - you will most likely experience a\nbrisket with a very low internal temperature.\n\nAside from having to potentially reheat a brisket that was rested for too long, there isn’t really any threat to the moisture or\ntenderness present within. It may actually be good to just rest it for as long as you possibly can, since resting for large\namounts of time can certainly help the moisture content steady out.

can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being said, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too short a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you let brisket rest the right way, you can rest assured that the results will be amazing every time you smoke one.</strong></p><hr/><h2>Can brisket rest too long? - Table of Contents:</h2><p><strong>How long is too long to let a brisket rest?</strong></p><p><strong>What Happens If You Let brisket rest too long?</strong></p><p><strong>Can you rest a brisket for 6 hours?</strong></p><p><strong>Is smoked brisket good the next day?</strong></p><p><strong>Is brisket better the next day?</strong></p><p><strong>What temperature do you slice brisket at?</strong></p><hr/><h2>Can brisket rest too long - <strong>How long is too long to let a brisket rest?</strong></h2><p>As a rule of thumb, for larger cuts like brisket - you will want to rest it for a time period greater than 3 hours. A way to ensure a properly rested brisket is to even try resting it for 8-12 hours. </p><p>Anything less than 3 hours for a rested brisket will create the chance that you will get a dry piece of meat. You don’t want that.</p><p>All you have to do is simply place it in either a Faux Cambro (ice chest) or some kind of warmer oven. This will ensure proper insulation, and will let the internal temperature of the brisket to come down steadily.  </p><p>Since brisket is just a giant piece of meat, you want to rest it just long enough (12 hours maximum) but not too long! Anything past 12 hours - and you should be questioning if you started the cook too long. </p><p>In other words, 12 hours for resting a brisket is more than sufficient to render all the moisture inside.</p><hr/><h2>Can brisket rest too long - <strong>What Happens If You Let brisket rest too long?</strong></h2><p>If you let a brisket rest too long, it will become too cold to eat and you will have to reheat it. </p><p>A good rule of thumb to follow for gauging the internal temperature of a brisket is to never let it go below 150 degree before serving. That is why if the brisket is rested for longer than the threshold of 12 hours - you will most likely experience a brisket with a very low internal temperature.</p><p>Aside from having to potentially reheat a brisket that was rested for too long, there isn’t really any threat to the moisture or tenderness present within. It may actually be good to just rest it for as long as you possibly can, since resting for large amounts of time can certainly help the moisture content steady out. Steadying out moisture just means the moisture inside the brisket isn’t way too hot, so when you slice it - it won’t immediately just vaporize and cause your meat to dry out instantly.</p><hr/><h2>Can brisket rest too long - <strong>Can you rest a brisket for 6 hours?</strong></h2><p>Yes, resting a brisket for 6 hours is the preferred method from many experienced Pit-Masters. Anything less than resting a brisket for 6 hours, and you run the chance of having it dry out.

However, if you’re just considering letting it come all the way down in internal temperatures, refrigerating it, reheating, then serving - you can still get some amazing results than you would have otherwise. </p><p>To make brisket better the next day - make sure you slowly let it come down in temperature before refrigerating. Once in the fridge and you are ready to start eating the next day, make sure to slowly start rising the internal temperature to roughly 15o degrees. This will ensure a great, warm, and moist brisket without losing much of it’s flavor. </p><hr/><h2>Can brisket rest too long - <strong>What temperature do you slice brisket at?</strong></h2><p>Slicing the brisket is another very important topic. Regarding what temperature you slice one - Do not slice until the brisket hits about 150 degrees in internal temperature. that will help to ensure that you don’t lose any moisture, and the brisket will respond accordingly.</p><p>When you want to slice a brisket, just ensure that you take the appropriate measure to keep the internal temperature within that range. If it goes below 150 degrees in internal temperature, you might have too cold of a brisket. If you try to cut the brisket above that amount, then you may start to lose all of the moisture that you’ve worked so hard to preserve!</p>"},"draftboxSettings":{"content":{"cta":{"showAfterPostContent":false},"subscribe":{"showAfterPostContent":true},"misc":{"loadComments":"Load Comments","share":"Share","minRead":"min read"}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"pathPrefix":""}},"prevPost":{"title":"Is smoked brisket good the next day? | YES","excerpt":"Smoked brisket is amazing when served the next day. In order to make this happen, make sure you pull the brisket off the smoker at\nthe right temps - 200 degrees internal, place it in the right storage container - ice chest or warming oven, and let it rest for\nno longer than 12 hours. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n> How do you reheat smoked brisket the next day?\n\nHow do you serve brisket the next day?\n\nHow long can a brisket rest after smoking?\n\nHow do you store smoked brisket overnight?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU REHEAT SMOKED BRISKET THE NEXT DAY?\nYOU CAN REHEAT SMOKED BRISKET THE NEXT DAY IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS. YOU CAN LET IT SIT IN YOUR HOLDING DEVICE - AN ICE\nCHEST OR OVEN - WITHOUT PUTTING IT INTO A FRIDGE AND SIMPLY JUST PLACE IT INTO THE OVEN OR SMOKER AGAIN TO LET THE INTERNAL HEAT\nCRANK BACK UP TO AROUND 150 DEGREES INTERNAL.\nBy doing this, you don’t have to wait for your brisket to thaw out essentially from being in a much colder environment for so long\nby being in the fridge. If you do try to just throw it back on the smoker, or oven though - make sure the brisket hasn’t been\nresting for more than 12 hours. Anything longer than 12 hours, and you risk the meat getting too cold at which point it’s best to\nplace it in the fridge.\n\nPRO TIP:\n\nDon’t slice into the brisket until absolutely necessary! \n\nIt’s a lot easier to get a tender and moist brisket when reheating a whole compacted one, rather than heating up individual\nslices. Don’t believe me? Salt Lick BBQ out in Driftwood, TX does this. They have found that the briskets come out even more\ntender when reheating the next day.\n\nAnother crazy tip you could employ:\n\nTry to save all the juices from the smoker, left over from the brisket smoke.\n\nPlace the brisket unwrapped on-top of all the juices, then let it reheat and baste over a low heat until ready to serve.\n\n> Could this be done in the oven? Took a while to reheat all with one crock pot\n\n\nThis method can absolutely be done in the oven. Just place both the broth and juices in a large metal container, then place the\nbrisket inside. \n\nPlace the heat on 250 degrees ambient temperature and you’ll be on your way to an amazing reheated brisket!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU SERVE BRISKET THE NEXT DAY?\nYou can serve brisket the next day by smoking the brisket a day in advance, and letting the brisket rest overnight to ensure that\nit will be ready for the next day. To prolong the resting time - wrap the brisket in foil or butcher paper - then place it into an\nice chest or oven to let it sit overnight.\n\nWhat you can do to time the cook appropriately is to ask yourself when you will be wanting to serve the next day (doesn’t have to\nbe an exact time - just an estimate).\n\nThen ask yourself when is a reasonable time for you to actually start cooking the meat.\n\nOnce you identify when you need to be serving - and an estimate of when you should start the cook, fire up that smoker!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG CAN A BRISKET REST AFTER SMOKING?\nLet brisket rest between 3-12 hours. When letting a brisket rest for that amount of time - you let the collagen, juices, and heat\nto all come to a screeching halt. It will ensure that the end product for your brisket is nice and juicy.\n\n The method above briefly describes how to serve the brisket the next day. You will want to make sure that no matter how or when\nyou are serving your brisket, always let it rest. \n\nI can’t tell you how many briskets I’ve give mine through, and when I didn’t let them rest properly - they were all dry.\n\nEvery single one of them!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU STORE SMOKED BRISKET OVERNIGHT?\nSTORE YOUR BRISKET OVER NIGHT BY TAKING IT OFF THE SMOKER, WRAPPING IT IN EITHER BUTCHER PAPER OR FOIL, THEN PLACE IT IN A WARMING\nOVEN OR ICE CHEST COOLER.\nWhen resting a smoked brisket overnight - make sure to not open any of the doors to the oven/ice cooler. This will let heat escape\nand possibly make the brisket come down to temps way too fast. Specifically, you don’t want your internal temperatures to dip\nbelow 150 degrees. This is why placing it in a preferred storage container is important. \n\n> What is a preferred storage container for resting smoked brisket overnight?\n\n\nAll that means is storing your brisket inside of an ice chest/cooler or a warming oven. \n\nWhen you take this approach, you can rest assured that your brisket will not dip in temperature too fast - the ambient and\ninternal temperatures will become steady and start to decrease a lot slower than otherwise noted.\n\nIf you also are smoking a pork shoulder - checkout this other blog post where I touch on how to rest one:\n\nCAN PULLED PORK REST TOO LONG?

Pit-Masters do it quite frequently. \n\nIf you’re wondering generally speaking how long to rest a brisket - the answer is usually it depends. That’s why I try to use the\nball park estimate of 12 hours. Obviously, there are a lot more factors that go into determining whether you can let a brisket\nrest over night such as your method of wrapping and storage location.\n\nThe methods of storing a brisket overnight are usually one of two things:\n\n1. Placing the brisket inside an ice chest (Faux Cambro)\n\n2. Placing the Brisket inside of the oven/warmer\n\nThese two methods of storing a brisket overnight will help to sufficiently not only keep the brisket temps stable, but will allow\na steady decrease in temperature over a longer period of time. \n\nWhen considering holding the brisket overnight - just be sure to finish the cook at a decent time, and factor in a rough estimate\nof about 8-12 of rest time in one of those two placement methods. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG?\nDon’t worry about resting a brisket too long, especially if you put in the effort of storing it properly. Resting a brisket in the\nproper location is critical. Like mentioned above, storing a brisket in either an ice chest cooler or a warming oven can allow you\nto hold a brisket for substantially longer periods of time than you otherwise could.\n\nThat being said, you CAN rest a brisket too long if you don’t follow the above advice. Any piece of meat, no matter how raging hot\nit currently is - will go cold at some point. You don’t want that.\n\nThe reason you want to be placing your brisket in a storage area that provides insulation is to allow all of the juices and the\nmeat itself to come to a reasonable temperature. You don’t want rapid spikes in heat in either direction. Placing it in a\ncontrolled environment will also allow you to make this a repeatable process thus allowing you to create some consistently great\nbarbecue!\n\nCheck out this article where I dive a litter deeper into this subject:\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? How long is too long to let a brisket rest? What Happens If You Let brisket rest too long? Can you rest\na brisket for 6 hours? Is smoked brisket good the next day? Is brisket better the next day? What temperature do you slice brisket\nat? BBQ Dropout\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - HOW LONG CAN YOU LET A BRISKET REST?\nLetting a brisket rest for long periods of time is completely fine, and often practiced by many experienced Pit-Masters. Ever\nnotice when you head to a really good barbecue restaurant and they’ll pull one of their juicy briskets out of a warmer? Those\nbriskets have been in there for quite a long time.\n\nAgain, generally speaking - you will want to rest a brisket for a substantial amount of time. This equates to roughly 8-12 hours.\nAnything past 12 hours is probably over kill - and if you need to let it rest any longer than that, you should start to ask\nyourself if you prepared the brisket too early before serving. \n\nAt the end of the day - you can rest assured that a brisket can tolerate not only a ton of heat and smoke during the cook, but\nafterwards - can certainly tolerate extended periods of time where it is simply resting.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum - it isn’t really suggested to let a brisket rest any shorter than 8-12 hours. That’s simply\nbecause the brisket - depending on the size - has been on the smoker for just about that time or even longer, which suggests that\nit is still blazing hot to come back down all the way to the right internal temp to begin slicing.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - IS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY?\nYes, brisket can be very good the next day. With everything though, it can depend, and you will want to take the appropriate steps\nto ensure the end product is amazing.\n\nA preferred method of experienced Pit-Masters to ensure a brisket can produce amazing results the next day - is to let it rest\nproperly. That means storing it in the ice chest or oven for a steady amount of internal temperature decrease. \n\nOften times, you will find that no matter how you prepare your brisket - you have no choice but to serve the next day anyways.\nThat’s just because of the length of cooking and resting time. If you add up roughly 12 hours for smoking and 8-12 hours of\nresting time - that’s just at around 24 hours total. \n\nIf you aren’t storing the brisket inside a refrigerator - meaning the internal temperature has never come down to sub 100 degree\nlevels - you can certainly serve a great piece of barbecue the next day.\n\nCheck out this article where I dive a litter deeper into this subject:\n\nIS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY? How do you reheat smoked brisket the next day? How do you serve brisket the next day? How\nlong can a brisket rest after smoking? How do you store smoked brisket overnight? BBQ Dropout\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - CAN BRISKET REST IN THE FRIDGE?\nYou absolutely can rest a brisket in the fridge. The reason you would do this is because you have finished smoking the brisket,\nand don’t necessarily need to slice into it anytime soon. This would also imply that you don’t mind having to reheat the brisket\nonce you are ready to start serving.\n\nIf you decide to serve the brisket and do not wish to reheat it, then it is not recommended to let it rest in the fridge. The\ninternal temperature of the brisket will get too low too quick thus requiring you to heat it back up again to an appropriately\nserve-able internal temperature.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - HOW LONG SHOULD BRISKET SIT BEFORE REFRIGERATING?\nIt does not matter how long you let a brisket sit before refrigerating. The only risk in that equation would be that the raging\nhot brisket could potentially cause the ambient temperature in the fridge to increase - which would spoil all the other contents\ninside. \n\nFor a general rule of thumb - Rest a brisket in an ice chest (Faux Cambro) or some kind of warming oven for about 8-12 hours -\nthen place the brisket inside of the refrigerator. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - IS IT BETTER TO CUT BRISKET HOT OR COLD?\nThis can be a tricky one. \n\nGenerally speaking, you want to consider how easy you want it to be to actually slice a brisket. If you were to slice the brisket\nwhile it is relatively warm - the knife should cut through it like butter. On the other-hand - if you were to attempt to slice the\nbrisket while it is cold and perhaps frozen, it would be very difficult to do so. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended to slice a brisket while it is warm/hot and NOT when it is cold.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - HOW DO YOU KEEP BRISKET MOIST AFTER CUTTING?\nKeeping brisket moist after cutting is a skill that not many can master. \n\nOne of the first things you will need to make sure you do is let the brisket a long enough time. This will ensure that the\nmoisture within the meat itself isn’t vaporized when you start to slice into it. \n\nThe second thing you need to do while you slice the brisket - is to make sure you don’t separate the slices apart from each other.\nThis helps to ensure that more of the moisture is retained within the meat. If you don’t, you’ll quickly notice that the meat will\nstart to dry out. \n\nBrisket is a very finicky piece of meat!","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"how-long-to-let-brisket-rest/","updatedAt":"22 June 2021","publishedAt":"22 June 2021"}},"pageContext":{"postSeoSlug":"can-brisket-rest-too-long/","prev":"is-smoked-brisket-good-the-next-day/","next":"how-long-to-let-brisket-rest/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["126537975","1898930737","1956324895","3147518746","333656818","3485313408"]}
