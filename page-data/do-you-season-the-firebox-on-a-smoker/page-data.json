If you want to buy a Costco Picanha, you are in luck! In this post\nwe’ll be discussing some high level points regarding all things Picanha at Costco.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOSTCO PICANHA - TABLE OF CONTENTS:\n> Does Costco sell Picanha?\n\nCostco Picanha Price?\n\nWhere can I find Picanha meat?\n\nIs Picanha a good cut?\n\nWhy is Picanha not popular?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES COSTCO SELL PICANHA?\nCostco definitely sells Picanha. If you are looking to buy one, you need to go to the meat section. Take a look in the bins, and\nexamine the contents. You will find all kinds of cryo-vacuumed sealed bags with tons of meat in them.\n\nThey come in packages of around two to three actual Picanha’s per bag. The price per pound for prime Picanha at Costco is roughly\n$6.69/lb. That can be a great bargain when shopping for some awesome meat.\n\nHere’s a picture of what they look like:\n\nPicanha at Costco - Top Sirloin CapThe only downside to buying a Picanha at Costco is that the Picanha Cuts you get in these\nvacuumed sealed bags is actually just the meat itself - with the fat cap removed!\n\nIf you want a Picanha with a great, juicy fat cap on top - you will need to head on over to the meat counter and promptly ask one\nof the meat butchers to provide you with the following: \n\n> Sirloin cap steak with the fat cap on\n\n\nThis will indicate to them that you want a Picanha with the fat cap still in tact. Personally, I LOVE having the fat cap on my\nPicanha’s.\n\nIf you DON’T want the fat cap on your Picanha when shopping at Costco - then you can just go back to the meat bins and pick up:\n\n> Beef Loin Top Sirloin Cap \n\n\nThis one will just be the Picanha without the fat cap in tact.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOSTCO PICANHA PRICE?\nPicanha at Costco comes in a variety of prices, determined primarily through the grade you are selecting. \n\nHere’s a list of Prices for Picanha when buying it at Costco:\n\nGrade of PicanhaPrice Per lbChoice$6.29/lbPrime$6.69/lbHere’s a couple pictures of each of the different grades of Picanha at\nCostco:\n\nPicanha at Costco - Choice and Prime Grade\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE CAN I FIND PICANHA MEAT?\nSince we’re talking about buying Picanha at Costco - all you need to do is head over to either the meat counter and ask the\nbutcher for a cut, or to walk over to the meat bin with the sealed bags. \n\nIf you don’t have a Costco nearby - don’t worry. Just follow the same process as mentioned above at your local grocery store and\ntry to see if they have availability.\n\nOne of the things I’ve noticed about buying Picanha at Costco and other grocery stores - you generally have to ask multiple people\nin order to find someone who actually knows what you’re talking about.\n\n> Can you ask this in store or do you need to order ahead?\n\n\nYou don’t need to call ahead - generally speaking - since Picanha is really not that well known anyways. Therefore, since there\nisn’t that much competition for getting that particular cut of meat - you can usually just show up and pick one up on the spot.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIS PICANHA A GOOD CUT?\nPicanha is an amazing cut of meat. It’s a traditionally selected form of serving meat in Brazil - and is better known by the\npreparation method. Specifically, it is served Churrascaria style. \n\nFor more information on what the different Picanha Cuts are:\n\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PICANHA CUTS? What are the different Picanha Cuts? There are three main Picanha Cuts. Individual Picanha\nSteaks, Picanha Roast, and Brazilian Churrascaria. BBQ DropoutWhen buying the Picanha Cut at Costco - it can come out amazingly\nwell. That is due to the fact that most of the meat you will find in Costco is tenderized, and has excellent marbling quality. \n\nThe marbling quality is simply a result of the grades you are selecting. Prime and Choice grade Picanha at Costco is among the\nmost popular types you will find.\n\nSince the Picanha at Costco doesn’t have a fat cap - some people claim that you don’t need one anyways just because of the\nexcellent quality of the meat with regards to the marbling. \n\nSpeaking of marbling, check this out:\n\nPicanha Costco - MarblingPersonally, I am of the opinion that when buying one at Costco - you will want to get one with the fat\ncap still in tact!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY IS PICANHA NOT POPULAR?\nPicanha is not that popular because it is traditionally a Brazilian style of preparing meat. That means since it’s a foreign cut\nof meat - not that many people in the States will actually know what it even is. \n\nThe one’s that do know what Picanah is are generally those who either frequent one of the many Brazilian steakhouses around the\nU.S. or they are barbecue connoisseur’s much like myself! \n\nWant to learn more about Picanha?

ALTHOUGH MORE EXPENSIVE, IT CAN COOK FASTER, HAS A HIGHER MARBLING CONTENT THAN\nCHOICE OR SELECT GRADES, AND MAKES FOR AN AMAZING AFTER PRODUCT.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n>  * Why is Brisket so expensive?\n * Which is better flat or point Brisket?\n * Does a prime brisket cook faster?\n * Brisket Cooking Too Fast?\n * Prime vs Choice Brisket\n * Select Brisket vs Prime\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY IS BRISKET SO EXPENSIVE?\nBRISKET IN GENERAL CAN BE A FAIRLY EXPENSIVE CUT OF MEAT SIMPLY DUE TO ITS’ SIZE. USUALLY, A SINGLE BRISKET PACKER WILL WEIGH\nANYWHERE FROM 10-25LBS. THAT’S A LOT OF MEAT. EVEN THOUGH THE BRISKET PRICE PER POUND IS RELATIVELY LOW - THE SHEER SIZE OF THE\nCUT IS WHAT MAKES THE PRICE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE.\nA lot of the actual price per pound of a particular brisket also revolves around supply and demand, like everything else. There\ncould be a cattle shortage, an increase in demand for beef, the list goes on. \n\nGenerally though in Texas - the Price per pound of prime grade brisket has never gone above $3.99. \n\nFor ‘lesser’ grades of brisket - it could be as low as $1.99 per pound for select and somewhere in between for choice grade\nbrisket.\n\nLet’s take an example of obtaining a giant, 20lb piece of brisket, and compare it against different prices for the different\ngrades I’ve seen:\n\nPrime Brisket Price:\n\n\n20lb X $3.99 = $79.80\n\n\n$79.80 for a 20lb piece of meat may sound like a lot, but it’s 20lbs of meat! That’s a lot of meat to consume. Brisket can be\ngreat for eating throughout the week - or perhaps cooking for a large event. Imagine trying to cook 20lbs of rib eye. That would\nbe tremendously more expensive than this.\n\nNot only do you get a great bang for your buck - but the entire 20lbs of meat is prime grade quality. You really can’t beat that.\n\nChoice Brisket Price:\n\n\n20lb X $2.99 = $59.80\n\n\n$59.80 for a 20lb piece of meat is certainly not bad either! Choice can be another great way to accommodate a large gathering or\nserve as the primary food for your entire week. The marbling isn’t as good as prime - but you can still save some extra money\nwhile consuming a very tasty piece of barbecue.\n\nSelect Brisket Price:\n\n\n20lb X $1.99 = $39.80\n\n\nCan you imagine getting roughly 20lbs of meat for only $39.80? That’s what you can get with Select Grade Brisket. That being said\n- with Select - you really have to consider that there’s probably a reason why it is so cheap. Generally, Select Grade Brisket is\na lot leaner than both choice and prime. That means it is a lot more prone to being dry, tough, and not as tender. \n\nStill though, any grade of brisket can come out great if you are an excellent pit master.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHICH IS BETTER FLAT OR POINT BRISKET?\nIT DEPENDS IF YOU LIKE EATING A FATTY OR LEAN PIECE OF MEAT. FOR BBQ DROPOUT - POINT BRISKET IS THE WAY TO GO. THE POINT OF THE\nBRISKET WILL LITERALLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.\nWhen you smoke your brisket - you will want to separate the point from the flat eventually. You do this when you are slicing - and\nthere’s even a whole technique to it. \n\nWhen deciding which to eat - or which is better - let’s take a look at the profile of each part of the brisket.\n\nFlat Part of the Brisket\n\nThe flat portion of the brisket is by far the leanest. It is also the most prone to the common pitfalls of smoking and slicing a\nbrisket - drying out. This is a very delicate part of the brisket, and it needs some special attention.\n\nDespite the special attention it may deserve - the taste and flavor profile can still be very rewarding. Most people seem to like\nleaner types of meat - and the flat part of the brisket can be a great option. It has the right amount of beefy flavor,\ntenderness, and leanness.\n\nPoint Part of the Brisket\n\nThe point portion of the brisket is my absolute favorite! The reasoning for this is simply because it’s like biting into the\njuiciest steak imaginable. The entire portion of the point part of the brisket just melts in your mouth - if it was cooked\ncorrectly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES A PRIME BRISKET COOK FASTER?\nI HAVE SEEN PRIME BRISKETS COOK FASTER THAN OTHER LESSER GRADES SUCH AS CHOICE AND SELECT. MY THEORY IS SIMPLY DUE TO THE FACT\nTHAT A PRIME BRISKET WILL GENERALLY HAVE MORE MARBLING - AND THEREFORE LESS CONNECTIVE TISSUE TO RENDER DOWN. THIS SIGNIFICANTLY\nSPEEDS UP THE COOK.\nWhen smoking a brisket you are rendering down all of the collagen and connective tissue inside the meat. That is why you may hear\na lot of people say you need to be pulling the brisket not only when the internal temperature is around 200 degrees AND it probes\ntender. That’s when the brisket is truly done.\n\nThis effect can be expedited with prime briskets.\n\nUsually what happens is a prime brisket has more overall marbling and fat content and perhaps not as much muscle or connective\ntissue to render down. Fat is a lot easier to render down than all of those really tough connective tissues!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBRISKET COOKING TOO FAST?\nBRISKET CAN COOK TOO FAST IF YOU HAVE IT WRAPPED, ARE COOKING IT TOO HOT, OR YOU ARE SMOKING WITH A QUALITY GRADE SUCH AS PRIME.\nIf your brisket does happen to find itself cooking too fast, there are a variety of things you could consider doing:\n\n * Decrease the smoker temps to help prolong the cook\n * Unwrap the brisket if it is wrapped \n * Place the brisket in a cooler or warming oven to prolong the holding and resting time\n\nOnce you have exhausted all of these options - you just have to accept your fate! \n\nHowever, is having a brisket really all that bad? Most of the time it smokes for 12 or more hours, but if you’re in a time crunch\nanyways - it’s not the end of the world.\n\nThey are all different. Every brisket is not the same and you have to learn how to adjust accordingly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPRIME VS CHOICE BRISKET?\nPRIME IS BETTER THAN CHOICE IF YOU WANT A WELL MARBLED, FATTIER, AND MORE TENDER CUT OF BRISKET. IF YOU WANT A SLIGHTLY MORE LEAN\nTYPE OF BRISKET THEN GRAB A CHOICE GRADE BRISKET.\nLike everything else in life - don’t trap yourself by dogma. Basically, you don’t always have to be getting the ‘best’ grade of\nbrisket out there. Lot’s of people will ONLY grab prime ‘just because’ and that’s not the way to do it. \n\nAs a pit master - use your head - are prime briskets REALLY all that good?\n\nYeah, they are really good. But sometimes people want something different - and that’s okay!\n\nALL THIS BEING SAID - LET’S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIME AND CHOICE BRISKET:\nPrime Brisket:\n\n * Much more marbling\n * More forgiving to cook (due to marbling)\n * Not as lean as choice or select\n * More expensive ($3.99/lb)\n\nChoice Brisket:\n\n * Not as much marbling as prime\n * Good balance between too fatty and too lean\n * Not as forgiving as prime when cooking (lack of marbling)\n * Less Expensive ($2.99lb)\n\nAs you can see - when you actually break down the data and stray away from being too abstract - there are very few differences\nbetween the two grades of brisket.\n\nIt really boils down to if you want to pay more for a more fattier type of brisket that can tolerate a little more beating in the\ncooking process. That’s it.\n\nSELECT BRISKET VS PRIME?\nSELECT BRISKET IS MORE LEAN THAN PRIME, WHILE PRIME BRISKET IS WAY MORE MARBLED.\nWhat really matters when deciding between the two is how skilled you are at maintaining consistent temperatures throughout the\ncooking process and if you want a leaner or fattier brisket.\n\nLET’S BREAK THIS ONE DOWN:\nSelect Brisket\n\n * Not as forgiving as choice or prime brisket (lack of marbling)\n * Cheaper than both choice and prime brisket ($1.99/lb)\n * A lot more lean than both choice and prime brisket\n * Requires more Pit Master Skill to cook properly (due to leanness)\n\nPrime Brisket\n\n * A lot more forgiving than select and choice grade brisket (more marbling)\n * More expensive than both select and choice ($3.99/lb)\n * Not as lean and is more tender than both select and choice\n * Does not require as much Pit Master skill to cook properly (due to marbling)\n\nWhat it boils down to regarding prime vs select brisket is the amount of skill you have in smoking a brisket. The select brisket\nis a lot more prone to drying out than prime brisket and therefore requires much more attention than a prime grade brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIS PRIME BRISKET WORTH THE MONEY - FINAL THOUGHTS:\nPrime brisket is worth the money if you have the budget to pay a little extra for an easier to cook piece of meat. Otherwise - go\nwith choice or select if you don’t have the budget but have the required pit master skills to properly cook a brisket.","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"is-prime-brisket-worth-the-money/","updatedAt":"03 July 2021","publishedAt":"23 June 2021"}},"pageContext":{"postSeoSlug":"do-you-season-the-firebox-on-a-smoker/","prev":"costco-picanha-everything-you-need-to-know/","next":"is-prime-brisket-worth-the-money/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["126537975","1898930737","1956324895","3147518746","333656818","3485313408"]}
