Often times with barbecue, you will need to rest the\npiece of meat for just as long as the actual cook takes. For pork shoulder, that means resting it for roughly 8-12 hours. This\nsimply lets the internal temperatures stabilize, and for all of the moisture inside the meat to replenish. If you don’t let a pork\nshoulder rest after smoking - you will absolutely have a dry piece of meat. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG DO YOU LET A PORK SHOULDER REST AFTER SMOKING - TABLE OF CONTENTS:\n> Can you let a pork shoulder rest overnight?\n\nWhy does pulled pork take so long?\n\nWhat temperature should I rest pulled pork?\n\nHow long can you let a pork shoulder rest?\n\nCan pulled pork rest too long? \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN YOU LET A PORK SHOULDER REST OVERNIGHT?\nYou can certainly let a pork shoulder rest overnight. In fact, it is highly recommended. The reason why you would want to rest a\npork shoulder overnight is comprised of multiple points:\n\n * Time you started your cook\n * Length of Cook\n * How large the pork shoulder is\n * Method of storing the pork shoulder\n * Estimated Serving time\n\nThese are just some general high level points to keep in mind that factor into why you should let a pork shoulder rest overnight. \n\nLet’s dig into some of them.\n\nTIME YOU STARTED YOUR COOK\nWhen you start smoking your pork shoulder: \n\n> Are you starting in the wee-hours of the morning?\n\nAre you starting in the afternoon?\n\nStarting the cook in the evening?\n\n\nThe time that you start smoking your pork shoulder is one of the most important qualities of the cook, and directly determines\nwhen you will potentially have to serve the meat. \n\nRemember - these cooks last anywhere from 8-12 hours OR LONGER. \n\nIf you start smoking your pork shoulder in the wee-hours of the morning - let’s say about 5am - you could estimate that you will\nfinish at roughly 5-6pm in the evening, and that’s being generous. \n\nLet’s quickly factor that time frame into the other two sub categories.\n\nIf you are smoking a pork shoulder in the middle of the afternoon - expect to have the cook finish right at midnight. \n\nAnd if you’re starting the cook in the evening - well, you are going to be up all night long!\n\nWe’ve quickly covered the points of when you will potentially have to start your cook, and how long it can take. Now, let’s\nconsider how large of a pork shoulder you’re smoking.\n\nA pork shoulder generally weighs anywhere from 10-20lbs, and a general rule of thumb to follow regarding how to estimate cook time\nis to count 1 hour of cook time per pound of meat. That means for a 15lb pork shoulder smoked at the standard 225 degrees - could\ntake over 15 hours! That is a huge factor that directly impacts how long you will be smoking your meat and by default - how long\nyou will rest the pork shoulder. \n\nOnce you consider when you start your actual cooking and how much the pork shoulder weighs - consider how you will begin to rest\nit.\n\nFor starters, there are a variety of methods I like to use for storing barbecue, and I cover some of them here for brisket:\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? | BBQ DROPOUT’S TAKE Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being\nsaid, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too short a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you\nlet brisket rest the right way, you can rest assured that the results will be amazing e… BBQ DropoutThe principles are the same,\nand you want to either store your pork shoulder in a faux cambro (ice chest) or an oven with a warming feature. \n\nThis can help prolong your resting if you need to serve at a specific time, or if you just want to have a way to control the\nambient temperature - which let’s the internal temps of your pork shoulder come down nice and steady. Having your temps come down\nsteady is a good thing, since you don’t want a lot of random fluctuations affecting your meat that you can’t control.\n\nAlright, now we’ve covered all of that - let’s take a quick look at why a pork shoulder takes so long to smoke!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY DOES PULLED PORK TAKE SO LONG?\nPork shoulder can take a substantially longer amount of time to not only smoke/cook, but to rest. The reasoning behind this is\njust due to the sheer size of the meat. Not only that, but when you place it off the smoker - it is raging hot. All of that meat,\nprotein, fat, and moisture is moving around inside and will promptly dry out if you cut into it too soon. \n\nFurthermore, with larger cuts such as pork shoulder - you will encounter something known as “the stall”. This is where the\ninternal temperature hits around 150-17o degrees internal, staying at that exact measure for hours on end. There’s a whole science\nbehind why that happens, but for simplicities sake - just keep smoking the meat - it will eventually progress through this\nstalling phase. \n\nFor those interested - basically what happens is the meat starts to sweat and actually cools down the meat. This seemingly\nprolongs the cooking process to several more hours and can certainly frustrate people that are new to barbecuing. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT TEMPERATURE SHOULD I REST PULLED PORK?\nThe temperature you should rest pulled pork should be when the pork shoulder reaches above 200 degrees internal. That can be a\ngreat way to indicate when the cook should come to an end. Even though you pull your pork shoulder off the smoker - that’s only\nhalf the battle!\n\nRegarding the temperature on when you should rest and pull it apart - that is generally anywhere from 150-160 degrees internal. \n\nWhatever you do - DO NOT PULL THE PORK UNTIL IT HITS AT LEAST 160 DEGREES INTERNAL!\n\nIf you make the mistake of tearing apart your pork shoulder before the temperature stabilizes to around 150-160 degrees - you will\nbe certain to have an unfortunately dry amount of pulled pork.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG CAN YOU LET A PORK SHOULDER REST?\nThe recommended length of time to let a pork shoulder rest is between 8-12 hours. This should give it ample time to come down in\ninternal temperature.\n\nYou don’t want to rest a pork shoulder longer than that time frame. Any longer, and you will risk either drying out the meat or\nrendering it too cold to serve. If you are trying to just let it rest for the purpose of letting all the moisture settle down\ninside - then it’s alright if you let it rest a little longer than 12 hours. \n\nLetting the pork shoulder rest longer than 12 hours should mean to you that it is headed straight to the fridge - otherwise it\nwill not be able to be served appropriately. Once you place it in the fridge for further resting, feel free to heat it back up to\nthe desired internal temperature - then start serving it. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN PULLED PORK REST TOO LONG?\nIt sure can! \n\nCheck out this article where I cover how long is too long for resting pulled pork:\n\nCAN PULLED PORK REST TOO LONG? | NO LONGER THAN 12 HOURS! Every piece of meat can rest too long. Pulled pork can rest in the oven\nor ice chest for about 8-12 hours. Anything longer - and you will have too cold of meat to serve.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------…\nBBQ Dropout","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"how-long-do-you-let-a-pork-shoulder-rest-after-smoking/","updatedAt":"23 June 2021","publishedAt":"23 June 2021"},"nextPost":{"title":"Is smoked brisket good the next day? | YES","excerpt":"Smoked brisket is amazing when served the next day. In order to make this happen, make sure you pull the brisket off the smoker at\nthe right temps - 200 degrees internal, place it in the right storage container - ice chest or warming oven, and let it rest for\nno longer than 12 hours. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n> How do you reheat smoked brisket the next day?\n\nHow do you serve brisket the next day?\n\nHow long can a brisket rest after smoking?\n\nHow do you store smoked brisket overnight?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU REHEAT SMOKED BRISKET THE NEXT DAY?\nYOU CAN REHEAT SMOKED BRISKET THE NEXT DAY IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS. YOU CAN LET IT SIT IN YOUR HOLDING DEVICE - AN ICE\nCHEST OR OVEN - WITHOUT PUTTING IT INTO A FRIDGE AND SIMPLY JUST PLACE IT INTO THE OVEN OR SMOKER AGAIN TO LET THE INTERNAL HEAT\nCRANK BACK UP TO AROUND 150 DEGREES INTERNAL.\nBy doing this, you don’t have to wait for your brisket to thaw out essentially from being in a much colder environment for so long\nby being in the fridge. If you do try to just throw it back on the smoker, or oven though - make sure the brisket hasn’t been\nresting for more than 12 hours. Anything longer than 12 hours, and you risk the meat getting too cold at which point it’s best to\nplace it in the fridge.\n\nPRO TIP:\n\nDon’t slice into the brisket until absolutely necessary! \n\nIt’s a lot easier to get a tender and moist brisket when reheating a whole compacted one, rather than heating up individual\nslices. Don’t believe me? Salt Lick BBQ out in Driftwood, TX does this. They have found that the briskets come out even more\ntender when reheating the next day.\n\nAnother crazy tip you could employ:\n\nTry to save all the juices from the smoker, left over from the brisket smoke.\n\nPlace the brisket unwrapped on-top of all the juices, then let it reheat and baste over a low heat until ready to serve.\n\n> Could this be done in the oven? Took a while to reheat all with one crock pot\n\n\nThis method can absolutely be done in the oven. Just place both the broth and juices in a large metal container, then place the\nbrisket inside. \n\nPlace the heat on 250 degrees ambient temperature and you’ll be on your way to an amazing reheated brisket!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU SERVE BRISKET THE NEXT DAY?\nYou can serve brisket the next day by smoking the brisket a day in advance, and letting the brisket rest overnight to ensure that\nit will be ready for the next day. To prolong the resting time - wrap the brisket in foil or butcher paper - then place it into an\nice chest or oven to let it sit overnight.\n\nWhat you can do to time the cook appropriately is to ask yourself when you will be wanting to serve the next day (doesn’t have to\nbe an exact time - just an estimate).\n\nThen ask yourself when is a reasonable time for you to actually start cooking the meat.\n\nOnce you identify when you need to be serving - and an estimate of when you should start the cook, fire up that smoker!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG CAN A BRISKET REST AFTER SMOKING?\nLet brisket rest between 3-12 hours. When letting a brisket rest for that amount of time - you let the collagen, juices, and heat\nto all come to a screeching halt. It will ensure that the end product for your brisket is nice and juicy.\n\n The method above briefly describes how to serve the brisket the next day. You will want to make sure that no matter how or when\nyou are serving your brisket, always let it rest. \n\nI can’t tell you how many briskets I’ve give mine through, and when I didn’t let them rest properly - they were all dry.\n\nEvery single one of them!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU STORE SMOKED BRISKET OVERNIGHT?\nSTORE YOUR BRISKET OVER NIGHT BY TAKING IT OFF THE SMOKER, WRAPPING IT IN EITHER BUTCHER PAPER OR FOIL, THEN PLACE IT IN A WARMING\nOVEN OR ICE CHEST COOLER.\nWhen resting a smoked brisket overnight - make sure to not open any of the doors to the oven/ice cooler. This will let heat escape\nand possibly make the brisket come down to temps way too fast. Specifically, you don’t want your internal temperatures to dip\nbelow 150 degrees. This is why placing it in a preferred storage container is important. \n\n> What is a preferred storage container for resting smoked brisket overnight?\n\n\nAll that means is storing your brisket inside of an ice chest/cooler or a warming oven. \n\nWhen you take this approach, you can rest assured that your brisket will not dip in temperature too fast - the ambient and\ninternal temperatures will become steady and start to decrease a lot slower than otherwise noted.\n\nIf you also are smoking a pork shoulder - checkout this other blog post where I touch on how to rest one:\n\nCAN PULLED PORK REST TOO LONG?
