Here’s what you need to know","slug":"buying-brisket-at-costco","postSeoSlug":"buying-brisket-at-costco/","publishedAt":"02 May, 2021","updatedAt":"03 July","excerpt":"Ever shop at Costco and think how amazing it is? The wholesale pricing scheme and general availability of whatever you could ever\nwant out of a large grocery store makes it the perfect place to get any type of food in bulk. You can buy more for less than you\ncould in a traditional grocery store, and that is why I wanted to cover Buying brisket at Costco:\n\n> Buying Brisket at Costco - Table of Contents:\n\nHow much is brisket at Costco?\n\nDoes Costco sell beef brisket?\n\nWhat is brisket called at Costco?\n\nHow much does Costco brisket cost?\n\nWhat is the best brisket to buy?\n\nHow much is Prime Brisket per pound?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH IS BRISKET AT COSTCO?\nOne of the neat things about brisket is that it is actually fairly cheap compared to more of the ‘desired’ cuts of meat such as\nribeye. Usually, Brisket at Costco averages anywhere from $1.99/lb for a really low grade all the way up to $6.99/lb for cuts like\nWaygu. \n\nEven at the upper end of the spectrum, that is miles apart from what you could see with other cuts of meat in the same grade. \n\nCOSTCO BRISKET PRICE (2021):\nSo, getting into the nitty gritty…\n\nHere’s the beef brisket price per pound at Costco:\n\nBrisket GradePrice Per PoundSelect$1.99/lbChoice$2.99/lbPrime$4.99/lb\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES COSTCO SELL BEEF BRISKET?\nThey absolutely do! \n\nOne of the best things about buying Brisket at Costco is that you can buy a ton in bulk, for a discounted rate. That means that\nyou can buy the more ‘expensive’ cuts or grades of brisket - for cheap.\n\nThe variety of briskets that Costco sells are diverse. \n\nHere’s the different types of brisket at Costco:\n\n * Whole Packer Style Briskets\n * Brisket Flat\n * Brisket Point\n\nAs you can tell - Costco has a fairly diverse selection on the type of brisket you can buy. This ranges from a packer style\nbrisket to just select parts of a particular brisket - the flat or the point.\n\nThis is common among many grocery stores. Their goals is to give the customer the most amount of selection desired. \n\nTypically, I like to just go straight for the whole packer style briskets. They are cheaper on a per pound basis, and you get to\ncook and modify the brisket as you like.\n\nHowever, some people just really like prepackaged parts of the brisket and will opt for either just a flat (leaner) or point\n(fattier) part of the brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS BRISKET CALLED AT COSTCO?\nCostco labels their briskets as:\n\n * USDA Prime Commodity Beef Brisket\n * USDA Choice Commodity Brisket\n * USDA Select Commodity Brisket\n\nThese are generally packer style briskets, meaning they are whole briskets that have not been sliced or cut into different pieces.\nTypically when this is done, the butcher will separate the point from the flat and sell each of those pieces individually for a\nhigher price per pound.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH DOES COSTCO BRISKET COST?\nA BRISKET AT COSTCO CAN SELL FOR ANYWHERE FROM $40-$70 FOR A WHOLE PACKER STYLE BRISKET.\nIt depends on the type of brisket you are buying and the grade of the brisket you are buying at Costco. What this means is that\nthere are a wide variety of briskets that Costco likes to package up and sell. \n\nLet’s look into this some more:\n\nTypes of Brisket at Costco:\n\n * Whole Packer Style Brisket\n * Flat Separated Brisket\n * Point Separated Brsiket\n\nPrice per pound of Brisket at Costco:\n\n * Prime Grade: $4.99/lb\n * Choice Grade: $2.99/lb\n * Select Grade: $1.99/lb\n\nPutting it Together:\n\nTo get the best bang for your buck when buying brisket at Costco - I recommend you to buy a whole packer style brisket. You are\njust buying all of the meat, and you are not being up-charged due to having a specialty cut of brisket. \n\nA recent example of a brisket I saw at Costco - a whole packer brisket weighed in at around 12 lbs, costing roughly $4.99lb. This\nequates to a total price of $63.82. \n\nIf you were to only take a flat cut of the brisket - weighing in at around 5lbs and costing almost $8.99lb (since it’s a specialty\ncut it’s more expensive on a per pound basis) - that would be roughy $45. So not only are you paying more for a smaller cut of\nbrisket - you’re paying more for a lesser grade of brisket as well.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS THE BEST BRISKET TO BUY?\nTHE BEST BRISKET TO BUY IS ONE THAT FITS INTO YOUR BUDGET. IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUDGET ROUGHLY $70 FOR A BRISKET -\nDEFINITELY GO WITH A WHOLE PRIME PACKER BRISKET. OTHERWISE - CONSIDER EITHER GOING FOR A LESSER GRADE WHOLE PACKER BRISKET OR\nPERHAPS A PRIME GRADE SPECIALTY CUT BRISKET.\nWhen buying a brisket at Costco - you will want to select one one the following order:\n\n 1. Prime Whole Packer Brisket (Budget $70)\n 2. Consider going for a lesser grade whole packer (Less than $70)\n 3. Choose a Prime grade special cut of brisket\n\nThe reason you always go with a whole packer brisket first is simply because it preserves the integrity of the meat, and allows\nyou to obtain even more meat than you would for the same price of a cut of specialty brisket. \n\nIn other words, buying a whole packer brisket is a lot more cost efficient than buying any kind of specially cut brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH IS PRIME BRISKET PER POUND?\nCOSTCO PRIME BRISKET PER POUND IS ROUGHLY $4.99/LB.\nCostco has a great selection of all types of meat, especially brisket. When looking in the meat counter bin - glance over at how\nmuch a prime brisket costs. As notated above, a single whole prime packer brisket can cost as much/little as $4.99/lb.\n\nWhen comparing this to other slices of meat that are of the same grade, quality or marbling, this can be an excellent deal. Not\nonly that, you get up to 20lbs of brisket at a time. That’s awesome.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBUYING BRISKET AT COSTCO - WRAPPING UP\nBUYING BRISKET AT COSTCO CAN SPUR VARIOUS QUESTIONS SUCH AS THOSE ANSWERED ABOVE. YOU CAN BUY MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF BRISKET -\nRANGING FROM DIFFERENT STYLES, GRADES, AND PRICES.","customExcerpt":"","readingTimeStr":"6 min read","readingTime":6,"primaryTag":{"name":"2021","slug":"2021"},"primaryAuthor":{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png"}},"authors":[{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1200'%20height='1543'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201543'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/1f8a1/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 80w","sizes":"40px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/e73fe/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/61ca6/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 80w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"40px"}]},"width":40,"height":40}}}}],"tags":[{"name":"2021","slug":"2021"},{"name":"Brisket","slug":"brisket"},{"name":"Prime","slug":"prime"},{"name":"Costco","slug":"costco"}],"featured":false,"featureImage":null}}]},"draftboxSettings":{"content":{"misc":{"post":"Post","posts":"Posts"},"subscribe":{"showAfterBlogfeed":true},"cta":{"showAfterBlogfeed":false}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"costco","limit":9,"skip":0,"numberOfPages":1,"humanPageNumber":1,"prevPageNumber":null,"nextPageNumber":null,"previousPagePath":null,"nextPagePath":null,"siteUrl":"https://bbqdropout.com","coverUrl":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1503314787","1898930737","1956324895","2904411447","3147518746","333656818","3485313408","3877759891"]}
