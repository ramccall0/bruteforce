MONEY. ALTHOUGH MORE EXPENSIVE, IT CAN COOK FASTER, HAS A HIGHER MARBLING CONTENT THAN\nCHOICE OR SELECT GRADES, AND MAKES FOR AN AMAZING AFTER PRODUCT.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n>  * Why is Brisket so expensive?\n * Which is better flat or point Brisket?\n * Does a prime brisket cook faster?\n * Brisket Cooking Too Fast?\n * Prime vs Choice Brisket\n * Select Brisket vs Prime\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY IS BRISKET SO EXPENSIVE?\nBRISKET IN GENERAL CAN BE A FAIRLY EXPENSIVE CUT OF MEAT SIMPLY DUE TO ITS’ SIZE. USUALLY, A SINGLE BRISKET PACKER WILL WEIGH\nANYWHERE FROM 10-25LBS. THAT’S A LOT OF MEAT. EVEN THOUGH THE BRISKET PRICE PER POUND IS RELATIVELY LOW - THE SHEER SIZE OF THE\nCUT IS WHAT MAKES THE PRICE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE.\nA lot of the actual price per pound of a particular brisket also revolves around supply and demand, like everything else. There\ncould be a cattle shortage, an increase in demand for beef, the list goes on. \n\nGenerally though in Texas - the Price per pound of prime grade brisket has never gone above $3.99. \n\nFor ‘lesser’ grades of brisket - it could be as low as $1.99 per pound for select and somewhere in between for choice grade\nbrisket.\n\nLet’s take an example of obtaining a giant, 20lb piece of brisket, and compare it against different prices for the different\ngrades I’ve seen:\n\nPrime Brisket Price:\n\n\n20lb X $3.99 = $79.80\n\n\n$79.80 for a 20lb piece of meat may sound like a lot, but it’s 20lbs of meat! That’s a lot of meat to consume. Brisket can be\ngreat for eating throughout the week - or perhaps cooking for a large event. Imagine trying to cook 20lbs of rib eye. That would\nbe tremendously more expensive than this.\n\nNot only do you get a great bang for your buck - but the entire 20lbs of meat is prime grade quality. You really can’t beat that.\n\nChoice Brisket Price:\n\n\n20lb X $2.99 = $59.80\n\n\n$59.80 for a 20lb piece of meat is certainly not bad either! Choice can be another great way to accommodate a large gathering or\nserve as the primary food for your entire week. The marbling isn’t as good as prime - but you can still save some extra money\nwhile consuming a very tasty piece of barbecue.\n\nSelect Brisket Price:\n\n\n20lb X $1.99 = $39.80\n\n\nCan you imagine getting roughly 20lbs of meat for only $39.80? That’s what you can get with Select Grade Brisket. That being said\n- with Select - you really have to consider that there’s probably a reason why it is so cheap. Generally, Select Grade Brisket is\na lot leaner than both choice and prime. That means it is a lot more prone to being dry, tough, and not as tender. \n\nStill though, any grade of brisket can come out great if you are an excellent pit master.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHICH IS BETTER FLAT OR POINT BRISKET?\nIT DEPENDS IF YOU LIKE EATING A FATTY OR LEAN PIECE OF MEAT. FOR BBQ DROPOUT - POINT BRISKET IS THE WAY TO GO. THE POINT OF THE\nBRISKET WILL LITERALLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.\nWhen you smoke your brisket - you will want to separate the point from the flat eventually. You do this when you are slicing - and\nthere’s even a whole technique to it. \n\nWhen deciding which to eat - or which is better - let’s take a look at the profile of each part of the brisket.\n\nFlat Part of the Brisket\n\nThe flat portion of the brisket is by far the leanest. It is also the most prone to the common pitfalls of smoking and slicing a\nbrisket - drying out. This is a very delicate part of the brisket, and it needs some special attention.\n\nDespite the special attention it may deserve - the taste and flavor profile can still be very rewarding. Most people seem to like\nleaner types of meat - and the flat part of the brisket can be a great option. It has the right amount of beefy flavor,\ntenderness, and leanness.\n\nPoint Part of the Brisket\n\nThe point portion of the brisket is my absolute favorite! The reasoning for this is simply because it’s like biting into the\njuiciest steak imaginable. The entire portion of the point part of the brisket just melts in your mouth - if it was cooked\ncorrectly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES A PRIME BRISKET COOK FASTER?\nI HAVE SEEN PRIME BRISKETS COOK FASTER THAN OTHER LESSER GRADES SUCH AS CHOICE AND SELECT. MY THEORY IS SIMPLY DUE TO THE FACT\nTHAT A PRIME BRISKET WILL GENERALLY HAVE MORE MARBLING - AND THEREFORE LESS CONNECTIVE TISSUE TO RENDER DOWN. THIS SIGNIFICANTLY\nSPEEDS UP THE COOK.\nWhen smoking a brisket you are rendering down all of the collagen and connective tissue inside the meat. That is why you may hear\na lot of people say you need to be pulling the brisket not only when the internal temperature is around 200 degrees AND it probes\ntender. That’s when the brisket is truly done.\n\nThis effect can be expedited with prime briskets.\n\nUsually what happens is a prime brisket has more overall marbling and fat content and perhaps not as much muscle or connective\ntissue to render down. Fat is a lot easier to render down than all of those really tough connective tissues!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBRISKET COOKING TOO FAST?\nBRISKET CAN COOK TOO FAST IF YOU HAVE IT WRAPPED, ARE COOKING IT TOO HOT, OR YOU ARE SMOKING WITH A QUALITY GRADE SUCH AS PRIME.\nIf your brisket does happen to find itself cooking too fast, there are a variety of things you could consider doing:\n\n * Decrease the smoker temps to help prolong the cook\n * Unwrap the brisket if it is wrapped \n * Place the brisket in a cooler or warming oven to prolong the holding and resting time\n\nOnce you have exhausted all of these options - you just have to accept your fate! \n\nHowever, is having a brisket really all that bad? Most of the time it smokes for 12 or more hours, but if you’re in a time crunch\nanyways - it’s not the end of the world.\n\nThey are all different. Every brisket is not the same and you have to learn how to adjust accordingly.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPRIME VS CHOICE BRISKET?\nPRIME IS BETTER THAN CHOICE IF YOU WANT A WELL MARBLED, FATTIER, AND MORE TENDER CUT OF BRISKET. IF YOU WANT A SLIGHTLY MORE LEAN\nTYPE OF BRISKET THEN GRAB A CHOICE GRADE BRISKET.\nLike everything else in life - don’t trap yourself by dogma. Basically, you don’t always have to be getting the ‘best’ grade of\nbrisket out there. Lot’s of people will ONLY grab prime ‘just because’ and that’s not the way to do it. \n\nAs a pit master - use your head - are prime briskets REALLY all that good?\n\nYeah, they are really good. But sometimes people want something different - and that’s okay!\n\nALL THIS BEING SAID - LET’S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIME AND CHOICE BRISKET:\nPrime Brisket:\n\n * Much more marbling\n * More forgiving to cook (due to marbling)\n * Not as lean as choice or select\n * More expensive ($3.99/lb)\n\nChoice Brisket:\n\n * Not as much marbling as prime\n * Good balance between too fatty and too lean\n * Not as forgiving as prime when cooking (lack of marbling)\n * Less Expensive ($2.99lb)\n\nAs you can see - when you actually break down the data and stray away from being too abstract - there are very few differences\nbetween the two grades of brisket.\n\nIt really boils down to if you want to pay more for a more fattier type of brisket that can tolerate a little more beating in the\ncooking process. That’s it.\n\nSELECT BRISKET VS PRIME?\nSELECT BRISKET IS MORE LEAN THAN PRIME, WHILE PRIME BRISKET IS WAY MORE MARBLED.\nWhat really matters when deciding between the two is how skilled you are at maintaining consistent temperatures throughout the\ncooking process and if you want a leaner or fattier brisket.\n\nLET’S BREAK THIS ONE DOWN:\nSelect Brisket\n\n * Not as forgiving as choice or prime brisket (lack of marbling)\n * Cheaper than both choice and prime brisket ($1.99/lb)\n * A lot more lean than both choice and prime brisket\n * Requires more Pit Master Skill to cook properly (due to leanness)\n\nPrime Brisket\n\n * A lot more forgiving than select and choice grade brisket (more marbling)\n * More expensive than both select and choice ($3.99/lb)\n * Not as lean and is more tender than both select and choice\n * Does not require as much Pit Master skill to cook properly (due to marbling)\n\nWhat it boils down to regarding prime vs select brisket is the amount of skill you have in smoking a brisket. The select brisket\nis a lot more prone to drying out than prime brisket and therefore requires much more attention than a prime grade brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIS PRIME BRISKET WORTH THE MONEY - FINAL THOUGHTS:\nPrime brisket is worth the money if you have the budget to pay a little extra for an easier to cook piece of meat. Otherwise - go\nwith choice or select if you don’t have the budget but have the required pit master skills to properly cook a brisket.","customExcerpt":"","readingTimeStr":"8 min read","readingTime":8,"primaryTag":{"name":"Brisket","slug":"brisket"},"primaryAuthor":{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png"}},"authors":[{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1200'%20height='1543'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201543'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/1f8a1/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 80w","sizes":"40px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/e73fe/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/61ca6/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 80w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"40px"}]},"width":40,"height":40}}}}],"tags":[{"name":"Brisket","slug":"brisket"},{"name":"Prime","slug":"prime"},{"name":"Price","slug":"price"},{"name":"Select","slug":"select"},{"name":"Choice","slug":"choice"},{"name":"Expensive","slug":"expensive"},{"name":"Cook Time","slug":"cook-time"}],"featured":false,"featureImage":null}},{"node":{"title":"Buying Brisket at Costco?

The wholesale pricing scheme and general availability of whatever you could ever\nwant out of a large grocery store makes it the perfect place to get any type of food in bulk. You can buy more for less than you\ncould in a traditional grocery store, and that is why I wanted to cover Buying brisket at Costco:\n\n> Buying Brisket at Costco - Table of Contents:\n\nHow much is brisket at Costco?\n\nDoes Costco sell beef brisket?\n\nWhat is brisket called at Costco?\n\nHow much does Costco brisket cost?\n\nWhat is the best brisket to buy?\n\nHow much is Prime Brisket per pound?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH IS BRISKET AT COSTCO?\nOne of the neat things about brisket is that it is actually fairly cheap compared to more of the ‘desired’ cuts of meat such as\nribeye. Usually, Brisket at Costco averages anywhere from $1.99/lb for a really low grade all the way up to $6.99/lb for cuts like\nWaygu. \n\nEven at the upper end of the spectrum, that is miles apart from what you could see with other cuts of meat in the same grade. \n\nCOSTCO BRISKET PRICE (2021):\nSo, getting into the nitty gritty…\n\nHere’s the beef brisket price per pound at Costco:\n\nBrisket GradePrice Per PoundSelect$1.99/lbChoice$2.99/lbPrime$4.99/lb\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES COSTCO SELL BEEF BRISKET?\nThey absolutely do! \n\nOne of the best things about buying Brisket at Costco is that you can buy a ton in bulk, for a discounted rate. That means that\nyou can buy the more ‘expensive’ cuts or grades of brisket - for cheap.\n\nThe variety of briskets that Costco sells are diverse. \n\nHere’s the different types of brisket at Costco:\n\n * Whole Packer Style Briskets\n * Brisket Flat\n * Brisket Point\n\nAs you can tell - Costco has a fairly diverse selection on the type of brisket you can buy. This ranges from a packer style\nbrisket to just select parts of a particular brisket - the flat or the point.\n\nThis is common among many grocery stores. Their goals is to give the customer the most amount of selection desired. \n\nTypically, I like to just go straight for the whole packer style briskets. They are cheaper on a per pound basis, and you get to\ncook and modify the brisket as you like.\n\nHowever, some people just really like prepackaged parts of the brisket and will opt for either just a flat (leaner) or point\n(fattier) part of the brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS BRISKET CALLED AT COSTCO?\nCostco labels their briskets as:\n\n * USDA Prime Commodity Beef Brisket\n * USDA Choice Commodity Brisket\n * USDA Select Commodity Brisket\n\nThese are generally packer style briskets, meaning they are whole briskets that have not been sliced or cut into different pieces.\nTypically when this is done, the butcher will separate the point from the flat and sell each of those pieces individually for a\nhigher price per pound.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH DOES COSTCO BRISKET COST?\nA BRISKET AT COSTCO CAN SELL FOR ANYWHERE FROM $40-$70 FOR A WHOLE PACKER STYLE BRISKET.\nIt depends on the type of brisket you are buying and the grade of the brisket you are buying at Costco. What this means is that\nthere are a wide variety of briskets that Costco likes to package up and sell. \n\nLet’s look into this some more:\n\nTypes of Brisket at Costco:\n\n * Whole Packer Style Brisket\n * Flat Separated Brisket\n * Point Separated Brsiket\n\nPrice per pound of Brisket at Costco:\n\n * Prime Grade: $4.99/lb\n * Choice Grade: $2.99/lb\n * Select Grade: $1.99/lb\n\nPutting it Together:\n\nTo get the best bang for your buck when buying brisket at Costco - I recommend you to buy a whole packer style brisket. You are\njust buying all of the meat, and you are not being up-charged due to having a specialty cut of brisket. \n\nA recent example of a brisket I saw at Costco - a whole packer brisket weighed in at around 12 lbs, costing roughly $4.99lb. This\nequates to a total price of $63.82. \n\nIf you were to only take a flat cut of the brisket - weighing in at around 5lbs and costing almost $8.99lb (since it’s a specialty\ncut it’s more expensive on a per pound basis) - that would be roughy $45. So not only are you paying more for a smaller cut of\nbrisket - you’re paying more for a lesser grade of brisket as well.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS THE BEST BRISKET TO BUY?\nTHE BEST BRISKET TO BUY IS ONE THAT FITS INTO YOUR BUDGET. IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUDGET ROUGHLY $70 FOR A BRISKET -\nDEFINITELY GO WITH A WHOLE PRIME PACKER BRISKET. OTHERWISE - CONSIDER EITHER GOING FOR A LESSER GRADE WHOLE PACKER BRISKET OR\nPERHAPS A PRIME GRADE SPECIALTY CUT BRISKET.\nWhen buying a brisket at Costco - you will want to select one one the following order:\n\n 1. Prime Whole Packer Brisket (Budget $70)\n 2. Consider going for a lesser grade whole packer (Less than $70)\n 3. Choose a Prime grade special cut of brisket\n\nThe reason you always go with a whole packer brisket first is simply because it preserves the integrity of the meat, and allows\nyou to obtain even more meat than you would for the same price of a cut of specialty brisket. \n\nIn other words, buying a whole packer brisket is a lot more cost efficient than buying any kind of specially cut brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH IS PRIME BRISKET PER POUND?\nCOSTCO PRIME BRISKET PER POUND IS ROUGHLY $4.99/LB.\nCostco has a great selection of all types of meat, especially brisket. When looking in the meat counter bin - glance over at how\nmuch a prime brisket costs. As notated above, a single whole prime packer brisket can cost as much/little as $4.99/lb.\n\nWhen comparing this to other slices of meat that are of the same grade, quality or marbling, this can be an excellent deal. Not\nonly that, you get up to 20lbs of brisket at a time. That’s awesome.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBUYING BRISKET AT COSTCO - WRAPPING UP\nBUYING BRISKET AT COSTCO CAN SPUR VARIOUS QUESTIONS SUCH AS THOSE ANSWERED ABOVE.

It already costs a significant amount of your time just cooking the thing, so it makes\nsense to buy the right one. \n\nHow do you determine the right brisket to buy at the right price? \n\nCheck your budget and analyze how much you are willing to expend. This should determine what grade you should be buying. What this\nmeans is, if you don’t have a TON of money to be spending on a finicky piece of meat like brisket, it’s probably not a good idea\nto be buying an expensive version of brisket. \n\nDon’t worry though, you can still smoke an amazing brisket without even having to buy an expensive grade such as prime or Waygu .\nIf you’re interested in learning more about USDA Prime brisket specifically, please reference this article where BBQ Dropout\nprovides in-depth insight:\n\nWHAT IS USDA PRIME BRISKET? What is USDA Prime Brisket? BBQ DropoutWhat you’ll want to look for in cases where you aren’t able to\nexpend anymore than $30 for a single brisket packer - you will want to look for an either select or choice grade brisket. If\nyou’re concerned about the price per pound for each grade of brisket - I’ll be covering that in just one moment.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE YOU ARE BUYING A PRIME BRISKET AND HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS CAN PLAY HEAVILY INTO THE PRICE\nThere’s two factors at play here:\n\n 1. Where you are buying the prime brisket from\n 2. How much the prime brisket weighs\n\nWHERE YOU ARE BUYING THE PRIME BRISKET FROM IS A PRETTY INTERESTING TOPIC:\n If you’re in the great state of Texas, you’re in luck! The wonderful grocery store H-E-B provides excellent pricing, especially\nfor brisket. We also have places like Costco, where you can certainly buy just as price effective briskets - but H-E-B is\nunparalleled. \n\nIf you’re in other parts of the United States, just go with Costco. It’s still a great place to source amazing quality barbecue.\nThey have all the different grades. Now, the only thing I’m uncertain of is - do they have all of the different grades PLUS\ndifferent variations of each grade of brisket?\n\nWhat I mean by that is, you have the top three grades of brisket - select, choice, prime. At H-E-B, you have all of that plus you\ncan easily pick up just the brisket flat, the brisket point, burnt ends, and trimmed briskets - all separately as their own piece.\nQuite amazing!\n\nAlright, so whether you are buying a prime grade brisket at either H-E-B, Costco, or any other grocery store nearest to you:\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT WEIGH?\nThat’s a great question. \n\nBBQ Dropout covered this in his latest post regarding what a USDA Prime Brisket is - however you want to get a piece of meat that\nis evenly distributed throughout. This means that both the flat and point are relatively consistent in their thickness. This\nprevents any possible over cooking. Believe me, I’ve done plenty of briskets where both Ends of the brisket were either severely\nunder cooked or severely overcooked or both. \n\nGet insight into how long to rest a brisket here:\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? | BBQ DROPOUT’S TAKE Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being\nsaid, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too short a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you\nlet brisket rest the right way, you can rest assured that the results will be amazing e… BBQ DropoutThis is just something that\nyou want to try and avoid because if you spend a lot of money on a certain brisket and you don’t precisely measure the sickness of\nthe point in the flat part of the brisket, then you open the possibility to really messing up your overall cook. \n\nNo, you don’t actually have to precisely measure the thickness and weight of the brisket, but it just helps to get and eyeballs\nglance of the relative thickness of each part of the brisket. What this means basically, is that you want to sickness of the flat\nand the point of the brisket to be relatively uniform. This will not only make sure that your cooks will come out great, but you\ncan rest assured that the weight distribution among all parts of the brisket are even.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBONUS:\nDepending on the grocery store do you happen to frequent, you will find that there are multiple types of brisket, with multiple\ndifferent grades of brisket, and most of all different cuts of brisket. Generally speaking a brisket that is in entire packer\nbrisket can range anywhere from 10 to 20 pounds. I personally have never found a brisket more than 20 pounds, but I do know that\nthey exist out in the wild.\n\n Usually, a good grocery store will actually package up a flat part of the brisket which is just the leaner, front part of the\nbrisket where it is harder to get tender. These can range anywhere from 3 to 5 pounds in weight. For the point sections of a\nbrisket that is packaged up as it’s on separate entity, you will generally find that they weigh about 3 pounds as well.\n\n Just be aware that these ranges can vary. \n\nI’m just trying to convey the average weight that I have personally seen.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOW, YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF HOW DOES ALL OF THIS PLAN TO THE PRICE OF THE ACTUAL BRISKET?\nThat is a really good question. When you factor in about $2.99 per pound in a prime brisket, this can add up quite a bit of\nmoney.. Which is why you want to Pay close attention to where you get your brisket from, and how much each brisket that you were\nbuying Weights.\n\nNow taking all of this into consideration, I definitely try to incorporate all of those above points. I try to go to the store\nwhether that be Costco or H-E-B that I believe will give me the best bang for my buck. I want to get the best possible price for\nthe best possible brisket so I can have an amazing output.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER\n To sum everything up, what I really want to stress is perhaps even take a look at the purpose of actually smoking a brisket. Do\nthis, and see what type of event we may be smoking for.\n\n Is it just for yourself?\n\n Or is it for a large event? \n\nThese factors could also play a part in the price of the brisket in which type of brisket you buy as well as the creative process.\nIt’s honestly pretty fun and the outcome is simply amazing. \n\n I generally try to keep my budget around $30-$50 in price for a single brisket regardless of whatever choice grade or prime grade\nbrisket it happens to be. Then, I will try to shop at either Costco or H-E-B. I believe they will give me the best price per pound\nof brisket, for the best grade.","customExcerpt":"","readingTimeStr":"7 min read","readingTime":7,"primaryTag":{"name":"Brisket","slug":"brisket"},"primaryAuthor":{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png"}},"authors":[{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1200'%20height='1543'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201543'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/1f8a1/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 80w","sizes":"40px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/e73fe/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/61ca6/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 80w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"40px"}]},"width":40,"height":40}}}}],"tags":[{"name":"Brisket","slug":"brisket"},{"name":"Prime","slug":"prime"},{"name":"Price","slug":"price"}],"featured":false,"featureImage":null}}]},"draftboxSettings":{"content":{"misc":{"post":"Post","posts":"Posts"},"subscribe":{"showAfterBlogfeed":true},"cta":{"showAfterBlogfeed":false}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"prime","limit":9,"skip":0,"numberOfPages":1,"humanPageNumber":1,"prevPageNumber":null,"nextPageNumber":null,"previousPagePath":null,"nextPagePath":null,"siteUrl":"https://bbqdropout.com","coverUrl":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1503314787","1898930737","1956324895","2904411447","3147518746","333656818","3485313408","3877759891"]}
