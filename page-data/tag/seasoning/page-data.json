SEASON THE FIREBOX ON A SMOKER. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE METAL INTEGRITY IS SUSTAINED. YOU DO NOT WANT TO\nNEGLECT THIS AS YOUR SMOKER FIREBOX WOULD BEGIN TO RUST, AND ULTIMATELY START ERODING THE METAL.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDO YOU SEASON THE FIREBOX ON A SMOKER? | YOUTUBE VIDEO\nDo you season the firebox on a smoker?TABLE OF CONTENTS:\n>  * Do you Season the Firebox on a Smoker?\n * How often do you re-season your offset firebox?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDO YOU SEASON THE FIREBOX ON A SMOKER?\nYou absolutely season the firebox on a smoker. Before you start applying oil and heat to seal the metal - you will want to begin\ncleaning all the ash and residual particles out of the inside of the firebox.\n\nIt’s worth taking a look at the YouTube video of BBQDROPOUT explaining his process on cleaning out the Offset Smoker Firebox. \n\nIn the video, it is very apparent how important it is to season and clean out your firebox for your smoker. To get started, you\nwill need two primary pieces of equipment:\n\n 1. Shovel to scoop all material out of the smoker firebox\n 2. Ash Bucket to capture all the material you are scooping out of the smoker firebox\n\nShovel to scoop all material out of the smoker firebox\n\nThis step is pretty easy. All you have to do is grab a shovel that is relatively short in length to allow for easy holding. Easy\nholding meaning - you can hold the shovel with one hand. This will allow you to position objects in the smoker firebox with one\nhand, while scooping them out with the shovel in the other hand. \n\nThis makes the process of cleaning the smoker firebox extremely easy and efficient!\n\nOpen the grates of your smoker firebox and take out any placement metal commonly used to hoist the wood on top of. Once all the\nmain metal and residual tools are out, you can simply start scraping all throughout the firebox. \n\nSometimes, there will be hard chunks that will be difficult to scrape out. Don’t be afraid to really hammer the metal - this thing\nis solid steel after all. \n\nAsh Bucket to Capture all the material you are scooping out of the smoker firebox\n\nOnce you have your handheld shovel and are scooping out all of the ash and burnt wood - make sure to have your ash bucket ready at\nthe bottom end of the firebox. That way you wont have to manually scoop and walk over to a nearby trash can. It’s all about\nefficiency. \n\nThe size and scope of your ash bucket can be any size you are comfortable with. I just got one from my local grocery store - HEB -\nand it is quite big.\n\nThis will allow for some amazing scooping of ash out of my Smoker Firebox!\n\nOnce you are about done scraping and scooping all the ash into your ash bucket - feel free to empty the bucket. Don’t get into the\nhabit of leaving it there. I’ve done that many times and before you know it - your ash bucket will start to rust! Definitely don’t\nwant that. \n\nAlso, if you have a habit of leaving your equipment out in the elements - especially when it is filled with ash and other left\nover material - rain will eventually come and you don’t want your ash bucket to become filled with ash and water. It is not a good\ncombination.\n\nIf you want an in-depth tutorial for how to clean an offset smoker:\n\nHOW TO CLEAN OFFSET SMOKER? Learn how to effectively clean an offset smoker! You’ll also learn how to properly prevent fire pit\nrust from accumulating, and how to season your smoker. BBQ Dropout\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW OFTEN DO YOU RE-SEASON YOUR OFFSET FIREBOX?\nYou should be re-seasoning your offset firebox before or after every cook. This will help ensure the metal integrity and get’s you\nin the habit of always keeping it clean.\n\nWhen you get into the habit of re-seasoning your offset firebox, you can rest assured your smoker will never rust. It will last\nyou forever - as long as you take care of it - the smoker will take care of you. \n\nHere’s a really neat video on how to clean an offset smoker\n\nHow Often Do You Re-Season Your Offset Firebox?In the above video, BBQDROPOUT walks you through exactly how to clean and season\nyour offset smoker. This method can be applied directly to any cast iron style smoker - not strictly an offset smoker. \n\nAnyways - you definitely will want to make sure not only do you clean your smoker firebox but season it.\n\nTo properly season your offset firebox - you will want to ensure it is clean - as per the above method where you get your handheld\nshovel and ash bucket - grab a jar of oil or a can of oil spray. \n\nOnce you have obtained oil that is easy to apply - go ahead and start spraying and applying the oil all over the outside AND\ninside. This step is crucial - since both sides are affected by rust. \n\nIt’s not just the Exterior.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUICK RE-CAP:\nWe’ve covered som pretty good ground in this article:\n\n> Do you season the firebox on a smoker\n\nHow often do you re-season your offset firebox?\n\n\nRegarding whether or not you should season your smoker firebox - the answer is always yes.
