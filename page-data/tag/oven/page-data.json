OFF THE SMOKER ONCE THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE HITS AT LEAST 200 DEGREES, THEN WRAP\nIT IN EITHER FOIL OF BUTCHER PAPER, AND PLACE IT IN A STORAGE CONTAINER SUCH AS A ICE CHEST OR WARMING OVEN. THIS WILL ENSURE THE\nINTERNAL TEMPERATURE IS HELD STABLE.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n> Pork shoulder resting period\n\nCan you put warm pulled pork in the fridge?\n\nCan I overcook pork shoulder?\n\nHow do you not overcook pork shoulder?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPORK SHOULDER RESTING PERIOD\nTHE RESTING PERIOD FOR PORK SHOULDER IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN 3-12 HOURS. THIS DEPENDS HOW LARGE THE CUT IS IN WEIGHT AND THE STORAGE\nMETHOD OF RESTING. IF A PORK SHOULDER IS PUSHING AROUND 20 LBS, EXPECT TO HAVE IT REST CLOSER TO THE 8-12 HOUR MARK. A PORK\nSHOULDER WEIGH IN AROUND 10 LBS, SHOULD ONLY REALLY REST ABOUT 3-8 HOURS.\nRegarding the storage method that you could use for resting your pork shoulder after smoking or cooking it refers to placing it in\neither an ice chest or warming oven. Not only that, but you should be considering wrapping your pork shoulder to further retain\nthe ambient and internal temperature within the meat. \n\nYou would want to do this if you really want to let the meat rest for an extended period of time. \n\nFor example, if you were wanting to perhaps serve it the next day - this can be a great option to still let the meat come down\nover a longer period of time. Basically just a technique commonly used by experienced pit-masters.\n\nIn terms of the average cook, you will still want to take the right precautions and ALWAYS rest it in either one of those to\npreferred storage methods.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN YOU PUT WARM PULLED PORK IN THE FRIDGE?\nYOU CAN CERTAINLY PUT WARM PULLED PORK IN THE FRIDGE. ALTHOUGH, IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO PUT FRESH OFF THE SMOKER AND VERY HOT\nPULLED PORK IN THE FRIDGE. YOU DON’T WANT EVERYTHING ELSE INSIDE TO WARM UP AND SPOIL.\nWhen you pull your pulled pork shoulder off of the smoker, you don’t want to get ahead of yourself and take the wrong steps in\nhandling the post smoke process. \n\nPulling your pulled pork off the smoker means you are ready to begin resting it. This can certainly be done in an ice\nchest/warming oven like mentioned above, and you can even rest it long term in the fridge. The only caveat to this is, you will\nwant to let the pork shoulder rest at least 3 hours before even thinking about putting it in the fridge. Again, you don’t want the\nambient temperature inside the fridge to start rising and spoil all of the perishables inside.\n\nThe overall goal of resting an amazingly smoked pork shoulder is to let the internal temperatures come down to a reasonable level.\nThis is around 150-170. Some pork shoulders get to that quicker than others, and is mainly dependent on how you store them after\nyou smoke in addition to how large the cut of meat is.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAN I OVERCOOK PORK SHOULDER?\nYOU CAN CERTAINLY OVERCOOK A PORK SHOULDER. THIS USUALLY OCCURS WHEN YOU LET THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE RISE ABOVE 205 DEGREES\nINTERNAL. YOU CAN ALSO DRY OUT A PULLED PORK SHOULDER BY PULLING IT BEFORE THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE HAS HAD AMPLE TIME TO STEAD\nOUT AT AROUND 150-170 DEGREES.\nGenerally, there are two ways to discern whether or not if your pork shoulder is overcooked or undercooked:\n\n 1. Over Cooked: 1. Pork shoulder pulls apart easily, but the strands are tough and stringy.\n    \n    \n 2. Under Cooked: 1. Pork shoulder will be a really tough piece of meat that you can’t seem to pull apart.\n    \n    \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU NOT OVERCOOK A PORK SHOULDER?\nNOT OVERCOOKING A PORK SHOULDER IS EASY. SIMPLY MONITOR THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURES BEFORE PULLING OFF THE SMOKER - WHEN IT HITS\n200-203 INTERNAL AND PROBES LIKE BUTTER - THEN LET IT REST FOR AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF TIME - 3-12 HOURS IN MOST CASES - AND ONLY PULL\nTHE MEAT APART WHEN THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE REACHES BETWEEN 150-170 DEGREES.\nWhat seems to make people confused and unsure about their meats being smoked it usually due to the fact that they are either\nimpatient, or aren’t measure their temperatures appropriately.\n\nBeing impatient: \n\nWhen Pit-Masters go through the trouble of smoking their pork shoulder, I have seen many mess up at the last minute and simply\npull the meat way too quick. They usually think that since it has already been over 12 hours since the start of the cook, are\ngetting tired, are getting hungry, etc. that means they can just pull the thing off the smoker grates.\n\nWRONG!\n\nThe last couple of miles in the cooking process are absolutely critical to ensuring an amazingly smoked pork shoulder. \n\nBy being too impatient - you are sacrificing your entire smoke and basically wasting your time and hard work. You DON’T want that!\n\nNot measuring the internal temperature correctly:\n\nThis is a huge topic, but essentially you just want to be using the right kind of temperature reading equipment. Get a quality\nthermometer, stick it inside the thickest part of your pork shoulder, then let it start reading the temps.\n\nOnce you’re able to get a good read on the internal temperature for your pork shoulder - be sure to pull it at roughly 200-203\ndegrees internal. Do NOT pull the meat before this stage. Some people will say that the meat can possibly be done in the low\n190’s, however I have yet to see that myself. \n\nWhen the temperature hits the famed 200-203 range, that is precisely when the collagen within the meat will begin to dissolve and\nmake the inside incredibly tender. \n\nThat’s why when you not only have the internal temperature reading at 200 degrees, many experienced pit-masters will also advise\n(myself included) to begin probing the meat with the thermometer to see if it’s like butter.","customExcerpt":"","readingTimeStr":"6 min read","readingTime":6,"primaryTag":{"name":"Pork","slug":"pork"},"primaryAuthor":{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png"}},"authors":[{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1200'%20height='1543'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201543'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/1f8a1/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 80w","sizes":"40px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/e73fe/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/61ca6/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 80w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"40px"}]},"width":40,"height":40}}}}],"tags":[{"name":"Pork","slug":"pork"},{"name":"Smoker","slug":"smoker"},{"name":"Resting","slug":"resting"},{"name":"Oven","slug":"oven"}],"featured":false,"featureImage":null}},{"node":{"title":"How long to let Brisket Rest | BBQ DROPOUT PRO TIPS","slug":"how-long-to-let-brisket-rest","postSeoSlug":"how-long-to-let-brisket-rest/","publishedAt":"22 June, 2021","updatedAt":"22 June","excerpt":"Wondering how long to let a brisket rest? This post will cover that topic in quite some detail. For the most part, it is\nrecommended to let a brisket rest at least 6-12 hours. That can be quite a lot of time, but if you want a great, moist, and tender\nbrisket that retains all of its’ moisture - that is what you should do. Trust me - i’ve tried!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - TABLE OF CONTENTS:\nCan I Let brisket rest overnight?\n\nCan brisket rest too long?\n\nHow long can you let a brisket rest?\n\nIs smoked brisket good the next day?\n\nCan brisket rest in the fridge?\n\nHow long should brisket sit before refrigerating?\n\nIs it better to cut brisket hot or cold?\n\nHow do you keep brisket moist after cutting?\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - CAN I LET BRISKET REST OVERNIGHT?\nYes, you can let a brisket rest overnight. Pit-Masters do it quite frequently. \n\nIf you’re wondering generally speaking how long to rest a brisket - the answer is usually it depends. That’s why I try to use the\nball park estimate of 12 hours. Obviously, there are a lot more factors that go into determining whether you can let a brisket\nrest over night such as your method of wrapping and storage location.\n\nThe methods of storing a brisket overnight are usually one of two things:\n\n1. Placing the brisket inside an ice chest (Faux Cambro)\n\n2. Placing the Brisket inside of the oven/warmer\n\nThese two methods of storing a brisket overnight will help to sufficiently not only keep the brisket temps stable, but will allow\na steady decrease in temperature over a longer period of time. \n\nWhen considering holding the brisket overnight - just be sure to finish the cook at a decent time, and factor in a rough estimate\nof about 8-12 of rest time in one of those two placement methods. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG?\nDon’t worry about resting a brisket too long, especially if you put in the effort of storing it properly. Resting a brisket in the\nproper location is critical. Like mentioned above, storing a brisket in either an ice chest cooler or a warming oven can allow you\nto hold a brisket for substantially longer periods of time than you otherwise could.\n\nThat being said, you CAN rest a brisket too long if you don’t follow the above advice. Any piece of meat, no matter how raging hot\nit currently is - will go cold at some point. You don’t want that.\n\nThe reason you want to be placing your brisket in a storage area that provides insulation is to allow all of the juices and the\nmeat itself to come to a reasonable temperature. You don’t want rapid spikes in heat in either direction. Placing it in a\ncontrolled environment will also allow you to make this a repeatable process thus allowing you to create some consistently great\nbarbecue!\n\nCheck out this article where I dive a litter deeper into this subject:\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? How long is too long to let a brisket rest? What Happens If You Let brisket rest too long? Can you rest\na brisket for 6 hours? Is smoked brisket good the next day? Is brisket better the next day? What temperature do you slice brisket\nat? BBQ Dropout\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - HOW LONG CAN YOU LET A BRISKET REST?\nLetting a brisket rest for long periods of time is completely fine, and often practiced by many experienced Pit-Masters. Ever\nnotice when you head to a really good barbecue restaurant and they’ll pull one of their juicy briskets out of a warmer? Those\nbriskets have been in there for quite a long time.\n\nAgain, generally speaking - you will want to rest a brisket for a substantial amount of time. This equates to roughly 8-12 hours.\nAnything past 12 hours is probably over kill - and if you need to let it rest any longer than that, you should start to ask\nyourself if you prepared the brisket too early before serving. \n\nAt the end of the day - you can rest assured that a brisket can tolerate not only a ton of heat and smoke during the cook, but\nafterwards - can certainly tolerate extended periods of time where it is simply resting.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum - it isn’t really suggested to let a brisket rest any shorter than 8-12 hours. That’s simply\nbecause the brisket - depending on the size - has been on the smoker for just about that time or even longer, which suggests that\nit is still blazing hot to come back down all the way to the right internal temp to begin slicing.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - IS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY?\nYes, brisket can be very good the next day. With everything though, it can depend, and you will want to take the appropriate steps\nto ensure the end product is amazing.\n\nA preferred method of experienced Pit-Masters to ensure a brisket can produce amazing results the next day - is to let it rest\nproperly. That means storing it in the ice chest or oven for a steady amount of internal temperature decrease. \n\nOften times, you will find that no matter how you prepare your brisket - you have no choice but to serve the next day anyways.\nThat’s just because of the length of cooking and resting time. If you add up roughly 12 hours for smoking and 8-12 hours of\nresting time - that’s just at around 24 hours total. \n\nIf you aren’t storing the brisket inside a refrigerator - meaning the internal temperature has never come down to sub 100 degree\nlevels - you can certainly serve a great piece of barbecue the next day.\n\nCheck out this article where I dive a litter deeper into this subject:\n\nIS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY? How do you reheat smoked brisket the next day? How do you serve brisket the next day? How\nlong can a brisket rest after smoking? How do you store smoked brisket overnight? BBQ Dropout\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - CAN BRISKET REST IN THE FRIDGE?\nYou absolutely can rest a brisket in the fridge. The reason you would do this is because you have finished smoking the brisket,\nand don’t necessarily need to slice into it anytime soon. This would also imply that you don’t mind having to reheat the brisket\nonce you are ready to start serving.\n\nIf you decide to serve the brisket and do not wish to reheat it, then it is not recommended to let it rest in the fridge. The\ninternal temperature of the brisket will get too low too quick thus requiring you to heat it back up again to an appropriately\nserve-able internal temperature.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - HOW LONG SHOULD BRISKET SIT BEFORE REFRIGERATING?\nIt does not matter how long you let a brisket sit before refrigerating. The only risk in that equation would be that the raging\nhot brisket could potentially cause the ambient temperature in the fridge to increase - which would spoil all the other contents\ninside. \n\nFor a general rule of thumb - Rest a brisket in an ice chest (Faux Cambro) or some kind of warming oven for about 8-12 hours -\nthen place the brisket inside of the refrigerator. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - IS IT BETTER TO CUT BRISKET HOT OR COLD?\nThis can be a tricky one. \n\nGenerally speaking, you want to consider how easy you want it to be to actually slice a brisket. If you were to slice the brisket\nwhile it is relatively warm - the knife should cut through it like butter. On the other-hand - if you were to attempt to slice the\nbrisket while it is cold and perhaps frozen, it would be very difficult to do so. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended to slice a brisket while it is warm/hot and NOT when it is cold.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - HOW DO YOU KEEP BRISKET MOIST AFTER CUTTING?\nKeeping brisket moist after cutting is a skill that not many can master. \n\nOne of the first things you will need to make sure you do is let the brisket a long enough time. This will ensure that the\nmoisture within the meat itself isn’t vaporized when you start to slice into it. \n\nThe second thing you need to do while you slice the brisket - is to make sure you don’t separate the slices apart from each other.\nThis helps to ensure that more of the moisture is retained within the meat. If you don’t, you’ll quickly notice that the meat will\nstart to dry out. \n\nBrisket is a very finicky piece of meat!","customExcerpt":"","readingTimeStr":"8 min read","readingTime":8,"primaryTag":{"name":"Brisket","slug":"brisket"},"primaryAuthor":{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png"}},"authors":[{"name":"BBQ Dropout","slug":"bbq-dropout","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1200'%20height='1543'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201543'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png","srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/f31ef/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/1f8a1/authorProfile_1609630463021.png 80w","sizes":"40px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/e73fe/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 40w,\n/static/7b206decb73ae3b9e7238fe5b34db2a8/61ca6/authorProfile_1609630463021.webp 80w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"40px"}]},"width":40,"height":40}}}}],"tags":[{"name":"Brisket","slug":"brisket"},{"name":"Oven","slug":"oven"}],"featured":false,"featureImage":null}},{"node":{"title":" Cooking the Picanha Cut","slug":"cooking-the-picanha-cut","postSeoSlug":"cooking-the-picanha-cut/","publishedAt":"20 April, 2021","updatedAt":"02 May","excerpt":"\nTL;DR\nThe purpose of this blog post is to show people how to cook the Picanha Cut of meat. There are many different ways to cook it, but\nfor now - we are doing it in the oven. When cooking the Picanha Cut, you will want to make sure that you first and foremost cook\nit to the right temperature. What temperature? Just make sure it comes up to at least 135 degrees Fahrenheit. For prepping the\nmeat - I like to use Kosher Salt & Black Pepper with a sprinkle of Garlic powder. Basically, just grab the Picanha Cut, and\npromptly lather the entirety of the meat with the seasoning until you see absolutely zero red. At this point, the Picanha Cut is\nnow completely seasoned and is ALMOST ready to place in your cooking device - I used an oven for this cook. Before actually\ncooking, make sure to WRAP the Picanha Cut in aluminum foil. Cook the Picanha Cut at an approximate ambient temperature of 400\ndegrees Fahrenheit and let it rip until it hits your desired temperature. Just make sure to let it rest for around 20 minutes\nbefore slicing.\n\nDONE!!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPICANHA CUT - GETTING STARTED\nAlright!\n\nMy favorite part of my blog posts - how to get started cooking a Picanha Cut of meat!\n\nWhat you need:\n\n * Picanha Cut (Duh)\n * Oven\n * Aluminum Foil\n * Kosher Salt & Black Pepper\n * Thermometer\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPICANHA CUT - KOSHER SALT & BLACK PEPPER SEASONING\nWhoohooo! Seasoning my FAVORITE piece of meat - the Picanha Cut. \n\nTo properly season this beautiful piece of meat - make sure you head on over to your favorite grocery store and take a gander upon\nthe meat selection. Depending on how sophisticated they are - you may or may not see it out on display. Bummer. It’s Okay though!\nJust go to the counter and ask the specifically for either:\n\n“Picanha Cut” OR “Top Sirloin Cap”\n\nSometimes, those behind the meat counter will not actually be aware what a Picanha Cut actually is. Once you have acquired the \nPicanha Cut, make sure when you’re ready to season it - you have a mixer bottle comprised of Kosher Salt & Black Pepper. Don’t\nforget the Garlic Powder as well!\n\nDetermining the correct amount of Seasoning for the Picanha Cut is really pretty simple. Grab your Seasoning ingredients and just\nsprinkle it all over the meat until it gets to a point where the entire surface area is completely covered. Don’t worry about\nmeasurements … every piece is different. That being said, just grab your bottle and get seasoning!\n\nThis is what the Picanha Cut should look like:\n\nCooking the Picanha Cut - Seasoning\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPICANHA CUT - ALUMINUM FOIL METHOD\nNow that your Picanha Cut has been seasoned properly, let’s talk about the Aluminum Foil Method. What does that even mean? It\nbasically is a way to ensure that your cut of meat is adequately wrapped in Aluminum Foil. This helps to ensure that a good amount\nof the moisture inside the meat is effectively trapped inside. You don’t want your Picanha Cut to come out dry do you? Nope!\n\nWrapping the meat is fairly straight forward. Get a standard thing of Aluminum Foil from your local grocery store and make sure to\npull out about a foot or two in length. Place your Picanha on one end, and make sure to start tucking the edges around the\nentirety of the meat, keep rolling it, and you should have something like you see below:\n\nCooking the Picanha Cut - foil wrap\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPICANHA CUT - THERMOMETER\nTime to measure the temperature! This is one of the most critical parts of cooking ANY cut of meat. It can actually get somewhat\ncomplicated, but a general rule of thump is to cook this specific cut of meat - to a temperature of roughly 135 Degrees\nFahrenheit. This will ensure it is Medium to Medium-Rare. \n\nWhat thermometer does the BBQ Dropout actually use? All kinds. But more often than not … will use the MEATER made thermometer.\nThis is the BEST thermometer on the market, and I have tried a lot of them. \n\nShortly after wrapping your Picanha Cut with aluminum foil, simply insert your MEATER probe. Once completed, just check your app\non your phone and set the cut of meat to ‘Picanha’. Promptly select your desired temperature (in this case - 135 degrees\nFahrenheit) and place in the oven!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPICANHA CUT - OVEN\nAlright, you have acquired your meat - the foil - the thermometer - now what?\n\nSimple.\n\nJust place your cut into the oven, and bake it at roughly 400 degrees Fahrenheit. There are a variety of ways to cook the meat -\nlow and slow - hot and fast - etc. The approach you will generally see on here is a hot and fast approach. This means baking it at\nfairly high temperatures to ensure a timely cook. Definitely do not want to be cooking for several hours!\n\nOnce your Picanha has finally come up to temp, go ahead and pull it from the oven.
