Quite amazing!</p><p>Alright, so whether you are buying a prime grade brisket at either H-E-B, Costco, or any other grocery store nearest to you:</p><h2><strong>How much does it weigh?</strong></h2><p>That’s a great question. </p><p>BBQ Dropout covered this in his latest post regarding what a USDA Prime Brisket is - however you want to get a piece of meat that is evenly distributed throughout. This means that both the flat and point are relatively consistent in their thickness. This prevents any possible over cooking.

What this means basically, is that you want to sickness of the flat and the point of the brisket to be relatively uniform. This will not only make sure that your cooks will come out great, but you can rest assured that the weight distribution among all parts of the brisket are even.</p><hr/><h2>Bonus:</h2><p>Depending on the grocery store do you happen to frequent, you will find that there are multiple types of brisket, with multiple different grades of brisket, and most of all different cuts of brisket. Generally speaking a brisket that is in entire packer brisket can range anywhere from 10 to 20 pounds. I personally have never found a brisket more than 20 pounds, but I do know that they exist out in the wild.</p><p> Usually, a good grocery store will actually package up a flat part of the brisket which is just the leaner, front part of the brisket where it is harder to get tender.  These can range anywhere from 3 to 5 pounds in weight. For the point sections of a brisket that is packaged up as it’s on separate entity, you will generally find that they weigh about 3 pounds as well.</p><p> Just be aware that these ranges can vary. </p><p>I’m just trying to convey the average weight that I have personally seen.</p><hr/><h3>Now, you may be asking yourself how does all of this plan to the price of the actual brisket?</h3><p>That is a really good question. When you factor in about $2.99 per pound in a prime brisket, this can add up quite a bit of money.. Which is why you want to Pay close attention to where you get your brisket from, and how much each brisket that you were buying Weights.</p><p>Now taking all of this into consideration, I definitely try to incorporate all of those above points. I try to go to the store whether that be Costco or H-E-B that I believe will give me the best bang for my buck. I want to get the best possible price for the best possible brisket so I can have an amazing output.</p><hr/><h2>Putting Everything Together</h2><p> To sum everything up, what I really want to stress is perhaps even take a look at the purpose of actually smoking a brisket.

Here’s what you need to know","excerpt":"Ever shop at Costco and think how amazing it is? The wholesale pricing scheme and general availability of whatever you could ever\nwant out of a large grocery store makes it the perfect place to get any type of food in bulk. You can buy more for less than you\ncould in a traditional grocery store, and that is why I wanted to cover Buying brisket at Costco:\n\n> Buying Brisket at Costco - Table of Contents:\n\nHow much is brisket at Costco?\n\nDoes Costco sell beef brisket?\n\nWhat is brisket called at Costco?\n\nHow much does Costco brisket cost?\n\nWhat is the best brisket to buy?\n\nHow much is Prime Brisket per pound?\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH IS BRISKET AT COSTCO?\nOne of the neat things about brisket is that it is actually fairly cheap compared to more of the ‘desired’ cuts of meat such as\nribeye. Usually, Brisket at Costco averages anywhere from $1.99/lb for a really low grade all the way up to $6.99/lb for cuts like\nWaygu. \n\nEven at the upper end of the spectrum, that is miles apart from what you could see with other cuts of meat in the same grade. \n\nCOSTCO BRISKET PRICE (2021):\nSo, getting into the nitty gritty…\n\nHere’s the beef brisket price per pound at Costco:\n\nBrisket GradePrice Per PoundSelect$1.99/lbChoice$2.99/lbPrime$4.99/lb\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES COSTCO SELL BEEF BRISKET?\nThey absolutely do! \n\nOne of the best things about buying Brisket at Costco is that you can buy a ton in bulk, for a discounted rate. That means that\nyou can buy the more ‘expensive’ cuts or grades of brisket - for cheap.\n\nThe variety of briskets that Costco sells are diverse. \n\nHere’s the different types of brisket at Costco:\n\n * Whole Packer Style Briskets\n * Brisket Flat\n * Brisket Point\n\nAs you can tell - Costco has a fairly diverse selection on the type of brisket you can buy. This ranges from a packer style\nbrisket to just select parts of a particular brisket - the flat or the point.\n\nThis is common among many grocery stores. Their goals is to give the customer the most amount of selection desired. \n\nTypically, I like to just go straight for the whole packer style briskets. They are cheaper on a per pound basis, and you get to\ncook and modify the brisket as you like.\n\nHowever, some people just really like prepackaged parts of the brisket and will opt for either just a flat (leaner) or point\n(fattier) part of the brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS BRISKET CALLED AT COSTCO?\nCostco labels their briskets as:\n\n * USDA Prime Commodity Beef Brisket\n * USDA Choice Commodity Brisket\n * USDA Select Commodity Brisket\n\nThese are generally packer style briskets, meaning they are whole briskets that have not been sliced or cut into different pieces.\nTypically when this is done, the butcher will separate the point from the flat and sell each of those pieces individually for a\nhigher price per pound.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH DOES COSTCO BRISKET COST?\nA BRISKET AT COSTCO CAN SELL FOR ANYWHERE FROM $40-$70 FOR A WHOLE PACKER STYLE BRISKET.\nIt depends on the type of brisket you are buying and the grade of the brisket you are buying at Costco. What this means is that\nthere are a wide variety of briskets that Costco likes to package up and sell. \n\nLet’s look into this some more:\n\nTypes of Brisket at Costco:\n\n * Whole Packer Style Brisket\n * Flat Separated Brisket\n * Point Separated Brsiket\n\nPrice per pound of Brisket at Costco:\n\n * Prime Grade: $4.99/lb\n * Choice Grade: $2.99/lb\n * Select Grade: $1.99/lb\n\nPutting it Together:\n\nTo get the best bang for your buck when buying brisket at Costco - I recommend you to buy a whole packer style brisket. You are\njust buying all of the meat, and you are not being up-charged due to having a specialty cut of brisket. \n\nA recent example of a brisket I saw at Costco - a whole packer brisket weighed in at around 12 lbs, costing roughly $4.99lb. This\nequates to a total price of $63.82. \n\nIf you were to only take a flat cut of the brisket - weighing in at around 5lbs and costing almost $8.99lb (since it’s a specialty\ncut it’s more expensive on a per pound basis) - that would be roughy $45. So not only are you paying more for a smaller cut of\nbrisket - you’re paying more for a lesser grade of brisket as well.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS THE BEST BRISKET TO BUY?\nTHE BEST BRISKET TO BUY IS ONE THAT FITS INTO YOUR BUDGET. IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUDGET ROUGHLY $70 FOR A BRISKET -\nDEFINITELY GO WITH A WHOLE PRIME PACKER BRISKET. OTHERWISE - CONSIDER EITHER GOING FOR A LESSER GRADE WHOLE PACKER BRISKET OR\nPERHAPS A PRIME GRADE SPECIALTY CUT BRISKET.\nWhen buying a brisket at Costco - you will want to select one one the following order:\n\n 1. Prime Whole Packer Brisket (Budget $70)\n 2. Consider going for a lesser grade whole packer (Less than $70)\n 3. Choose a Prime grade special cut of brisket\n\nThe reason you always go with a whole packer brisket first is simply because it preserves the integrity of the meat, and allows\nyou to obtain even more meat than you would for the same price of a cut of specialty brisket. \n\nIn other words, buying a whole packer brisket is a lot more cost efficient than buying any kind of specially cut brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH IS PRIME BRISKET PER POUND?\nCOSTCO PRIME BRISKET PER POUND IS ROUGHLY $4.99/LB.\nCostco has a great selection of all types of meat, especially brisket. When looking in the meat counter bin - glance over at how\nmuch a prime brisket costs. As notated above, a single whole prime packer brisket can cost as much/little as $4.99/lb.\n\nWhen comparing this to other slices of meat that are of the same grade, quality or marbling, this can be an excellent deal. Not\nonly that, you get up to 20lbs of brisket at a time. That’s awesome.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBUYING BRISKET AT COSTCO - WRAPPING UP\nBUYING BRISKET AT COSTCO CAN SPUR VARIOUS QUESTIONS SUCH AS THOSE ANSWERED ABOVE. YOU CAN BUY MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF BRISKET -\nRANGING FROM DIFFERENT STYLES, GRADES, AND PRICES.","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"buying-brisket-at-costco/","updatedAt":"03 July 2021","publishedAt":"02 May 2021"},"nextPost":{"title":"What is USDA Prime Brisket? | 6 Questions to Consider","excerpt":"What is USDA Prime Brisket? I’m glad you asked! Get ready. We’re going to be covering the following topics:\n\n * What is USDA Prime Brisket?\n * Is prime brisket worth the money?\n * Why is prime brisket cheaper than choice?\n * How do you pick a beef brisket?\n * What is the best brisket to buy?\n * Prime Brisket Price?\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS USDA PRIME BRISKET?\nThat’s a very good question! Only the best piece of meat in the WORLD. This is actually a highly sought after topic, as you can\nsee from the list above. Frankly, it doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of all things Brisket. Let alone Prime Brisket.\nThere’s just so much that goes into picking the right sized cut of meat, how to cook it, equipment involved, the list goes on!\n\nNow, in case you were wondering … a USDA Prime Brisket is one of the best grades you can possibly buy from a grocery store. \n\n> How is that? \n\n\nSimple. The fat contents. Ever heard of marbling? That just means there is a lot of interconnected fat between the muscle fibers\nin the meat. Basically, the cow was really fat and juicy!\n\n> Cool. So, what is USDA?\n\n\nUSDA in this context stands for the United States Department of Agriculture. It is an official attestation to you, as the\ncustomer, that any cut of meat you are about to buy is effectively certified by a governing agency. Think of it as the\ngovernment’s seal-of-approval. Not that you always need government approval, but it’s just a way of implementing relatively strict\nstandards for meat processing.\n\nIn that respect, a USDA Prime Brisket is truly one of the best tasting, tender, and forgiving pieces of brisket. Granted, Brisket\nis generally coveted as one of the more difficult pieces of barbecue to get right. That being said, getting a Prime Brisket will\ngenerally speaking will be a lot easier to cook properly rather than a lesser grade such as Choice and Select. This is due to the\nfat contents.\n\n> Can I please see a picture of a Prime Brisket?\n\n\nYou sure can! Here you go:\n\nUSDA Prime Grade Brisket\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIS PRIME BRISKET WORTH THE MONEY?\nYou know, i’ve often wondered that very question myself. Short answer is yes. Long answer is … it depends. When I first started\nbarbecuing, I was a broke college kid working a job at HEB (local grocery store here in Texas). Not having a ton of money - I\nstarted at the absolute bottom of the barrel. My brisket career began with a Select Grade cut of brisket. The very first cook with\nit was miserable too. It took over 24 hours and the thing just came out SO dry. That wasn’t the last time I ever smoked a Select\nGrade brisket, but I definitely try to only go for Prime now.\n\n> yeah but, why is that?\n\n\nI’ll tell you why. Prime Grade brisket is generally a fattier piece of meat. Having a fat piece of barbecue will only make things\ntaste better and is generally very forgiving. Brisket is already a finicky enough cut as it is, and by getting one with plenty of\nmarbling - you will effectively be creating some amazing barbecue. \n\nThat being said, they can be fairly pricey. The averaged size brisket you will see here in the great state of TEXAS is on average\nbetween 10lbs-20lbs. That is a LOT of meat! Even though the price is relatively low compared to something like a Ribeye, due to\nthe large quantity - you will be paying roughly $40-$50 per brisket in that pound range. Don’t worry though, it’s literally an\nalmost 20lb piece of meat. Think about how long that will last you. No joke - a brisket can last you the entire week. Plus it\ntastes AMAZING!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY IS PRIME BRISKET CHEAPER THAN CHOICE?\n> Is that really the case?\n\n\nSometimes it may seem like it is! However, you have to realize what you are comparing. Simply saying prime is cheaper than choice\nopens the door for more questions. You also have to check if you are really comparing the exact same CUT of brisket.\n\n> What do you mean by CUT of brisket?\n\n\nWhat I mean is … Brisket is generally sold in a variety of formats, other than just the grade of fat contents. I told you these\nare loaded questions! \n\nTo get a better understanding of the different cuts of brisket please see the following:\n\n * Brisket Packer\n * Brisket Flat\n * Brisket Point\n * Brisket Burnt Ends\n\nThese are generally the most common forms of brisket that you will either hear about or come across.\n\nBRISKET PACKER\nA Brisket Packer is the whole brisket. This means the flat, point, and burnt end portions are all included. This is the most\nfamous cut of brisket and will be primarily what you will see talked and posted about in this blog. The brisket is actually a\ncombination of two muscles - the point and flat. The point is the meatier and fattier portion while the flat is the leaner and\nlesser part of the overall brisket.\n\nBRISKET FLAT\nThe brisket flat is, like I said, the leaner portion of the brisket. It’s also the most prone to going dry, so watch out for that!\nIt really takes a true pit-master to not only make sure it comes out alright, but to ensure all areas of the brisket are well\ntaken care of. You will find brisket flats all around the grocery store much like you would a packer style brisket. The difference\nis just - what part you want the most.\n\nBRISKET POINT\nThe brisket point is honestly my favorite part of the meat. That’s simply due to the amount of flavor, fat, and tenderness that\ncomes with it. The Point of a brisket, notably a USDA Prime Brisket, will provide you with the upmost flavor. It’s almost too\noverwhelming and rich, but will certainly be one of the most amazing pieces of meat you will EVER experience. \n\nBRISKET BURNT ENDS\nBrisket burnt ends are another great delicacy. They are essentially the brisket point - cubed up into smaller pieces called ‘ends’\nand are thrown back onto the smoker (or whatever cooking device you are using) for maximum fat caramelization. Yes, they are quite\namazing. Usually you have to make them yourself since most grocery stores don’t cater to that specific palate. That being said,\nthey are definitely. \n\nThat should all clear things up regarding the different CUTS of brisket. Now, let’s revisit the overarching question:\n\n> Why is prime brisket cheaper than choice?\n\n\nThe answer would depend on whether or not you are actually comparing the same cut of brisket. Meaning, are you comparing two\nbrisket packers together? \n\nOr are you comparing a USDA Prime Grade Packer Brisket which a Choice Grade Flat? \n\nSee the difference?\n\nGenerally speaking, the divided up portions of the brisket will be more expensive on a per pound basis regardless of the Grade you\nselect. This means that the Packer style briskets will be cheaper overall on a per pound basis than a separated flat, point, or\nburnt ends style brisket. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW DO YOU PICK A BEEF BRISKET?\nThis can be harder than it seems … but don’t worry - i’ll tell you how! \n\nJust make sure that you head on over to your local grocery store - in my case, that is H-E-B. Walk over to the meat market display\nand see what’s available. For the purpose of this post, we’ll be discussing how to select a USDA Prime Brisket. Take a look at\nwhat you have at your disposal - how many briskets are there in the case? Sometimes here in Texas most of the good quality\nbriskets are all picked over!\n\nThis means that what I would commonly have to do, especially around any important holiday - is to get there early. YUP that is a\npro tip. Let me reiterate:\n\nTo get the best selection of USDA Prime Brisket - Get to the store early!!\n\nMost meat markets will actually get shipments everyday - early in the morning. Getting to the store right as they open will simply\nensure that you have the best possible selection. For other cuts of meat such as Picanha, the same method applies. If you don’t\nknow what Picanha is or how to smoke/cook one, checkout my previous blog posts where I shed some light on that here:\n\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PICANHA CUTS? What are the different Picanha Cuts? There are three main Picanha Cuts. Individual Picanha\nSteaks, Picanha Roast, and Brazilian Churrascaria. BBQ DropoutSMOKING PICANHA ON A SMOKER TL;DR To get the best Smoked Picanha you\nwill firstly want to start your smoker well before you start your cook. This will ensure that the heat is high enough and you\nwon’t have to wait around for the temperature to come up when you place your Smoked Picanha on the grate. Once your Smoker is up\nto … BBQ DropoutAt this point in the process, you have gotten to the store and ensured you have maximized the possibility of you\nfinding the perfect Prime Brisket. That’s GREAT! But not all it takes. \n\nYou’ll see very quickly that there are a lot of different sized briskets, each with varying degrees of marbling, and packaging.\nSome look fresh and red - and some look loosely vacuumed sealed. You definitely don’t want one that is loosely sealed. You also\ndon’t want one with an uneven thickness. What I mean by that point is that you should be checking to see if both sides of the meat\nare in proportion to one another. A Prime Grade Brisket with a huge point but a little tiny flat is probably not one you want to\nbe smoking. Other wise you will way over cook the flat before you ever are able to cook through the point. Mind Blown!\n\nThere’s even another factor that goes into selecting the correct brisket - the bend test!\n\n> What in tarnation is the bend test?\n\n\nThis is a term applied to two different stages in the brisket process - selecting and assessing the finished product. For purposes\nof this post, I’ll just focus on the first meaning - The bend test. When selecting the most epic Prime Grade Brisket is when you\nhave determined it is of excellent marbling, thickness, and proportion. A combination of all three of these very important\nselections will let you place the brisket over your hand (you have to be strong since it’s a potentially 20lb piece of meat) and\nlet it bend over both sides of your hand. This will attest to the true fat and protein ratios present within. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS THE BEST BRISKET TO BUY?\nThe best brisket to buy, is generally speaking one that you can afford and that will give you the best end product. It’s really a\ncombination of those two factors. Believe me, I understand how expensive a single cut of brisket can cost. Especially a Prime\nGrade Brisket.\n\n You know what? Let me write a separate post specifically around this topic:\n\nWHAT IS THE BEST BRISKET TO BUY? What is the Best Brisket to Buy? I’ve been wondering that myself! Let’s dig into the following\nquestions: * What is the Best Brisket to Buy? * Is Costco Prime Beef Really Prime Beef? * How much is Prime Brisket per pound? *\nWhy is Brisket so expensive? * Where is the best place to buy brisket… BBQ DropoutTake a gander at the above post. Essentially\nwhat you want to look at your budget. What amount of money are you able to expend for an amazingly marbled Prime Grade Brisket?\nOnce you have determined that important factor - take a look at what grade of brisket you are interested in. Generally, I only buy\nUSDA Prime Grade Brisket. That isn’t because I am a BBQ Snob, it’s because I really enjoy all of the marbling that comes with it.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPRIME BRISKET PRICE?\nThere are varying degrees in price ranges for brisket. The difference in prices are generally from the different grades of brisket\nyou can pick up, the difference in weight, and the different stores selling briskets.\n\nFor more information into this subject, reference this blog post:\n\nThe prices across the board all vary to a significant degree. This is even more true when considering specifically USDA Prime\nGrade Brisket. In my situation, a recent look at some briskets at H-E-B (again, my local grocery store) was roughly $3 per lb!\nThis doesn’t seem like a lot, but when multiplying that by the average weight of the meat - 15-20lbs - it can definitely add up.\n\nLet’s use an example of taking a USDA Prime Grade Brisket that weighs 15lbs and cost about $3 per pound:\n\n\n15lbs X $3 per Pound = $45\n\n\nThis may not seem like a lot, but if you are catering for a large crowd - this can certainly add up. That’s why it’s important to\nconsider the three main points laid out previously:\n\n 1. Your budget\n 2. Grade of Brisket\n 3. Where you are sourcing your brisket\n\nFor more information into this subject, reference this blog post:\n\nPRIME BRISKET PRICE? | THREE POINTS TO MAKE Let’s talk about how much a prime brisket is! There are generally speaking three main\npoints to make: * What your budget is * The Grade of Brisket you are interested in buying * Where you are buying the Brisket All\nthree vectors will help provide you with further insight.
