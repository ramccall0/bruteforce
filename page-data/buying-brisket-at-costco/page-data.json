Usually, Brisket at Costco averages anywhere from $1.99/lb for a really low grade all the way up to $6.99/lb for cuts like\nWaygu. \n\nEven at the upper end of the spectrum, that is miles apart from what you could see with other cuts of meat in the same grade. \n\nCOSTCO BRISKET PRICE (2021):\nSo, getting into the nitty grittyâ€¦\n\nHereâ€™s the beef brisket price per pound at Costco:\n\nBrisket GradePrice Per PoundSelect$1.99/lbChoice$2.99/lbPrime$4.99/lb\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES COSTCO SELL BEEF BRISKET?\nThey absolutely do! \n\nOne of the best things about buying Brisket at Costco is that you can buy a ton in bulk, for a discounted rate. That means that\nyou can buy the more â€˜expensiveâ€™ cuts or grades of brisket - for cheap.\n\nThe variety of briskets that Costco sells are diverse. \n\nHereâ€™s the different types of brisket at Costco:\n\n * Whole Packer Style Briskets\n * Brisket Flat\n * Brisket Point\n\nAs you can tell - Costco has a fairly diverse selection on the type of brisket you can buy. This ranges from a packer style\nbrisket to just select parts of a particular brisket - the flat or the point.\n\nThis is common among many grocery stores. Their goals is to give the customer the most amount of selection desired. \n\nTypically, I like to just go straight for the whole packer style briskets. They are cheaper on a per pound basis, and you get to\ncook and modify the brisket as you like.\n\nHowever, some people just really like prepackaged parts of the brisket and will opt for either just a flat (leaner) or point\n(fattier) part of the brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS BRISKET CALLED AT COSTCO?\nCostco labels their briskets as:\n\n * USDA Prime Commodity Beef Brisket\n * USDA Choice Commodity Brisket\n * USDA Select Commodity Brisket\n\nThese are generally packer style briskets, meaning they are whole briskets that have not been sliced or cut into different pieces.\nTypically when this is done, the butcher will separate the point from the flat and sell each of those pieces individually for a\nhigher price per pound.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH DOES COSTCO BRISKET COST?\nA BRISKET AT COSTCO CAN SELL FOR ANYWHERE FROM $40-$70 FOR A WHOLE PACKER STYLE BRISKET.\nIt depends on the type of brisket you are buying and the grade of the brisket you are buying at Costco.

You are\njust buying all of the meat, and you are not being up-charged due to having a specialty cut of brisket. \n\nA recent example of a brisket I saw at Costco - a whole packer brisket weighed in at around 12 lbs, costing roughly $4.99lb. This\nequates to a total price of $63.82. \n\nIf you were to only take a flat cut of the brisket - weighing in at around 5lbs and costing almost $8.99lb (since itâ€™s a specialty\ncut itâ€™s more expensive on a per pound basis) - that would be roughy $45. So not only are you paying more for a smaller cut of\nbrisket - youâ€™re paying more for a lesser grade of brisket as well.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS THE BEST BRISKET TO BUY?\nTHE BEST BRISKET TO BUY IS ONE THAT FITS INTO YOUR BUDGET.

Prime Whole Packer Brisket (Budget $70)\n 2. Consider going for a lesser grade whole packer (Less than $70)\n 3. Choose a Prime grade special cut of brisket\n\nThe reason you always go with a whole packer brisket first is simply because it preserves the integrity of the meat, and allows\nyou to obtain even more meat than you would for the same price of a cut of specialty brisket. \n\nIn other words, buying a whole packer brisket is a lot more cost efficient than buying any kind of specially cut brisket.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MUCH IS PRIME BRISKET PER POUND?\nCOSTCO PRIME BRISKET PER POUND IS ROUGHLY $4.99/LB.\nCostco has a great selection of all types of meat, especially brisket. When looking in the meat counter bin - glance over at how\nmuch a prime brisket costs. As notated above, a single whole prime packer brisket can cost as much/little as $4.99/lb.\n\nWhen comparing this to other slices of meat that are of the same grade, quality or marbling, this can be an excellent deal. Not\nonly that, you get up to 20lbs of brisket at a time. Thatâ€™s awesome.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBUYING BRISKET AT COSTCO - WRAPPING UP\nBUYING BRISKET AT COSTCO CAN SPUR VARIOUS QUESTIONS SUCH AS THOSE ANSWERED ABOVE.

Specifically, the best wood for smoking pork is\nOak wood. The reason Oak wood is the best word for smoking pork is because it has a light and sweet aroma and taste that gets\nimparted onto the meat perfectly. Most other types of wood do not do this. Types of wood like Mesquite are way too strong. Fruit\ntree such as Apple, or cherry, are on the opposite end of the spectrum and are simply not strong enough to impart any kind of\nmeaningful flavor to the meat itself. Now, all of that being said you can certainly use other types of wood for smoking pork that\narenâ€™t oak wood. \n\nHERE ARE THE BEST TYPES OF WOOD FOR SMOKING PORK:\n 1. Oak \n 2. Pecan \n 3. Hickory \n 4. Mesquite\n\nOAK WOOD FOR SMOKING PORK\nOakwood is part of the Quintessential Texas Style method for smoking pork. It has excellent flavor profiles, ranging from hard and\nsmoky to sweet and flavorful. Most people in Texas especially, will only use Oakwood to smoke all of their meat. Itâ€™s not only for\nsmoking pork. This means that you are commonly find people using any type of OakWord to smoke any type of meat in their smoker.\nAnother great choice while using Oakwood for smoking meat would have to be a brisket and ribs of all kinds. Speaking of pork, it\nusually has a natural sweet taste to it, so by using pork and Oak wood together makes it a perfect duo. \n\nNot only that, there are even different types of Oak wood that you can use to smoke pork. This includes Post Oak, live Oak, red\noak, and white oak. All of which have the same over arching sweet flavor profile mixed in with a hearty smoke flavor. The most\nprominent type of Oak wood to be smoking pork with however, is Postoak. That is what I mean by the quintessential Texas style Way\nof smoking pork. Not only does Oak wood in general pair well with pork for smoking, it also serves as a great base for applying\nseasoning to the meat. Regarding seasoning and putting it on your smoked pork, Oakwood is most beneficially paired with kosher\nsalt and black pepper. Regarding this specific types of cuts of pork that is greatly paired with Oak Wood, pulled pork, pork ribs,\npork shoulder, and even ham all can have amazing flavor. Not only is Oak wood great at imparting differing degrees of flavor into\nyour pork, the texture is quite versatile as well. Most woods you have to pick based on their flavor and texture because some of\nthem burn quicker than others. Oak of all kinds has the unique property of being able to be burned with either hot and fast or low\nand slow types of cooks. \n\nBEST WOOD FOR SMOKING PULLED PORK\nHaving pulled pork shoulder paired with Oakwood specifically is an amazing combo. The pork shoulder has a high fat content which\nis somewhat salty and rich but simply melts in your mouth when combined with the sweet and savory taste of Oakwood. Pairing any of\nthe above mentioned types of Oakwood like Post Oak or Live Oak to a pork shoulder creates a simply amazing product of barbecue. \n\nBest wood for smoking pork? Post OakPECAN WOOD FOR SMOKING PORK\nPecan wood is an interesting type of wood to be smoking with in the first place. It has a light and nutty note to it, and also can\ncaptivate anyone around when you were actually smoking with the wood itself. The reason it tends to get a lot of attention when\nyou are smoking with it is because of its unique scent. Not only does it have an amazing scent filled profile, Pecan wood is great\nat imparting that flavor on to even the roughest cuts of meat like pork. It can be a great way to combine the nutty flavor into\nthe rich and fatty parts of your cook. The texture of the wood itself is also great for cooking low and slow. It doesnâ€™t really\nburn that hot or fast - so it makes for an excellent combination when combined with those traditional cuts of pork that need to be\ncooked very thoroughly such as pork shoulder. Pork shoulder usually requires long cooks just due to the general size of the cuts\nof meat you will get, and depending on the preference of the pit-master can be a great type of wood to get smoking with pork.\n\nSMOKING PORK ON PECAN\nAs mentioned above, pecan wood can be an excellent way to get a low and slow cooked piece of pork. Since generally speaking itâ€™s a\nlight burning type of wood you are going to predominantly be smoking those larger cuts like a pork shoulder. The smoke flavor will\nbe rather nutty in profile and provide a very mild smoke ring to the meet. Depending on what seasoning you actually are\nconsidering and using, it can serve as a gray undertone for the meat.\n\nAnd most cooks that I have done with pecan and pork shoulder specifically, the bark has never really been that dark in the outer\ncrust has never really been two overtly burnt or charred which is an excellent quality.\n\nHICKORY WOOD FOR SMOKING PORK\nHickory is one of the types of word where the flavor skews more towards being smoky. Not only does it have that smokiness flavor\nto it, but it also has a lot of no and hearty types of flavor to it. Along with pecan wood, hickory is a great and versatile way\nto smoke any kind of barbecue. Commonly however,People will tend to use it for the tough cuts of meat such as pork and brisket.\nBetween those two types of meats Hickory is best served alongside pork. The reason for that is because brisket should only ever be\nsmoked with Oakwood. That is just the Texas way of doing things sorry yâ€™all! \n\nHickory also it does not tend to burn as hot and fast as some of its other wood counterparts. If you want a low and slow type of\ncook and are also thinking of smoking a pork shoulder of some kind you should be thinking of hickory or pecan wood for that. \n\nSMOKING PORK ON HICKORY\nIf youâ€™re looking for a nutty, earthy, but yet slightly Smokey flavor - youâ€™ll want to smoke some pork over a few chunks of\nHickory. Hickory can be one of the best types of wood if youâ€™re looking for a lighter version of Oak Wood. Pork shoulder is a\ngreat option for hickory. Usually, it doesnâ€™t take a whole lot of effort to impart a lot of wood flavor onto pork shoulder.\nBrisket on the other hand, is a much tougher piece of meat to get the flavor just right.\n\nDespite brisket being a relatively difficult piece of barbecue to nail with just about every type of wood, pork shoulder can\ncertainly obtain flavor from all of the types I mention in this article. At this point itâ€™s really a matter of preference as to\nwhich type of wood is best for smoking pork.\n\nSMOKING PORK SHOULDER ON HICKORY\nSo, you want to smoke a pork shoulder over Hickory? Excellent choice!\n\nIf you choose to use a pork shoulder while cooking with hickory, just know that overall, pork is a great piece of meat to impart\nsmoke flavor onto. It can take on plenty of smoke flavor while also taking on the individual characteristics of each respective\ntype of wood. For hickory - you will be able to combine the natural fatty profile of the pork shoulder along with the earthy,\nnutty, and general smoke flavor into the meat. \n\nTake a look below - you should see a slight smoke ring on the tips of the pork shoulder:\n\nBest wood for smoking pork? - Pork over HickoryMESQUITE WOOD FOR SMOKING PORK\nMesquite is one of the strongest types of wood you could be using for pork. Not only that, it is generally considered the number\none guaranteed way to impart a very strong smoke flavor onto ANY type of barbecue. Itâ€™s primarily one of the types of wood\nactually used for tougher cuts such as brisket - but definitely has applications for lesser tough cuts such as pork shoulder. Itâ€™s\nnot really recommended to use it on other general types of meat like pork loin, pork chops, and pork ribs - UNLESS you want a\nREALLY Smokey flavor. \n\nThe qualities preset throughout a mesquite smoked piece of pork will present you with a very Smokey filled flavor. There arenâ€™t a\nwhole lot of mineral or earthy components to the taste, nor are there any type of nutty tones. This wood is strictly if you want\nthe general taste of something REALLY smokey. And I mean REALLY SMOKEY. Thatâ€™s honestly what mesquite wood is for. Itâ€™s primarily\nfor the most thickets cuts of meat, specifically barbecue oriented cuts of meat.

It already costs a significant amount of your time just cooking the thing, so it makes\nsense to buy the right one. \n\nHow do you determine the right brisket to buy at the right price? \n\nCheck your budget and analyze how much you are willing to expend. This should determine what grade you should be buying. What this\nmeans is, if you donâ€™t have a TON of money to be spending on a finicky piece of meat like brisket, itâ€™s probably not a good idea\nto be buying an expensive version of brisket. \n\nDonâ€™t worry though, you can still smoke an amazing brisket without even having to buy an expensive grade such as prime or Waygu .\nIf youâ€™re interested in learning more about USDA Prime brisket specifically, please reference this article where BBQ Dropout\nprovides in-depth insight:\n\nWHAT IS USDA PRIME BRISKET? What is USDA Prime Brisket? BBQ DropoutWhat youâ€™ll want to look for in cases where you arenâ€™t able to\nexpend anymore than $30 for a single brisket packer - you will want to look for an either select or choice grade brisket. If\nyouâ€™re concerned about the price per pound for each grade of brisket - Iâ€™ll be covering that in just one moment.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE YOU ARE BUYING A PRIME BRISKET AND HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS CAN PLAY HEAVILY INTO THE PRICE\nThereâ€™s two factors at play here:\n\n 1. Where you are buying the prime brisket from\n 2. How much the prime brisket weighs\n\nWHERE YOU ARE BUYING THE PRIME BRISKET FROM IS A PRETTY INTERESTING TOPIC:\n If youâ€™re in the great state of Texas, youâ€™re in luck! The wonderful grocery store H-E-B provides excellent pricing, especially\nfor brisket. We also have places like Costco, where you can certainly buy just as price effective briskets - but H-E-B is\nunparalleled. \n\nIf youâ€™re in other parts of the United States, just go with Costco. Itâ€™s still a great place to source amazing quality barbecue.\nThey have all the different grades. Now, the only thing Iâ€™m uncertain of is - do they have all of the different grades PLUS\ndifferent variations of each grade of brisket?\n\nWhat I mean by that is, you have the top three grades of brisket - select, choice, prime. At H-E-B, you have all of that plus you\ncan easily pick up just the brisket flat, the brisket point, burnt ends, and trimmed briskets - all separately as their own piece.\nQuite amazing!\n\nAlright, so whether you are buying a prime grade brisket at either H-E-B, Costco, or any other grocery store nearest to you:\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT WEIGH?\nThatâ€™s a great question. \n\nBBQ Dropout covered this in his latest post regarding what a USDA Prime Brisket is - however you want to get a piece of meat that\nis evenly distributed throughout. This means that both the flat and point are relatively consistent in their thickness. This\nprevents any possible over cooking. Believe me, Iâ€™ve done plenty of briskets where both Ends of the brisket were either severely\nunder cooked or severely overcooked or both. \n\nGet insight into how long to rest a brisket here:\n\nCAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? | BBQ DROPOUTâ€™S TAKE Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being\nsaid, you donâ€™t want to rest a brisket for too short a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you\nlet brisket rest the right way, you can rest assured that the results will be amazing eâ€¦ BBQ DropoutThis is just something that\nyou want to try and avoid because if you spend a lot of money on a certain brisket and you donâ€™t precisely measure the sickness of\nthe point in the flat part of the brisket, then you open the possibility to really messing up your overall cook. \n\nNo, you donâ€™t actually have to precisely measure the thickness and weight of the brisket, but it just helps to get and eyeballs\nglance of the relative thickness of each part of the brisket. What this means basically, is that you want to sickness of the flat\nand the point of the brisket to be relatively uniform. This will not only make sure that your cooks will come out great, but you\ncan rest assured that the weight distribution among all parts of the brisket are even.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBONUS:\nDepending on the grocery store do you happen to frequent, you will find that there are multiple types of brisket, with multiple\ndifferent grades of brisket, and most of all different cuts of brisket. Generally speaking a brisket that is in entire packer\nbrisket can range anywhere from 10 to 20 pounds. I personally have never found a brisket more than 20 pounds, but I do know that\nthey exist out in the wild.\n\n Usually, a good grocery store will actually package up a flat part of the brisket which is just the leaner, front part of the\nbrisket where it is harder to get tender. These can range anywhere from 3 to 5 pounds in weight. For the point sections of a\nbrisket that is packaged up as itâ€™s on separate entity, you will generally find that they weigh about 3 pounds as well.\n\n Just be aware that these ranges can vary. \n\nIâ€™m just trying to convey the average weight that I have personally seen.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOW, YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF HOW DOES ALL OF THIS PLAN TO THE PRICE OF THE ACTUAL BRISKET?\nThat is a really good question. When you factor in about $2.99 per pound in a prime brisket, this can add up quite a bit of\nmoney.. Which is why you want to Pay close attention to where you get your brisket from, and how much each brisket that you were\nbuying Weights.\n\nNow taking all of this into consideration, I definitely try to incorporate all of those above points. I try to go to the store\nwhether that be Costco or H-E-B that I believe will give me the best bang for my buck. I want to get the best possible price for\nthe best possible brisket so I can have an amazing output.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER\n To sum everything up, what I really want to stress is perhaps even take a look at the purpose of actually smoking a brisket. Do\nthis, and see what type of event we may be smoking for.\n\n Is it just for yourself?\n\n Or is it for a large event? \n\nThese factors could also play a part in the price of the brisket in which type of brisket you buy as well as the creative process.\nItâ€™s honestly pretty fun and the outcome is simply amazing. \n\n I generally try to keep my budget around $30-$50 in price for a single brisket regardless of whatever choice grade or prime grade\nbrisket it happens to be. Then, I will try to shop at either Costco or H-E-B. I believe they will give me the best price per pound\nof brisket, for the best grade.","customExcerpt":"","postSeoSlug":"prime-brisket-price/","updatedAt":"02 July 2021","publishedAt":"01 May 2021"}},"pageContext":{"postSeoSlug":"buying-brisket-at-costco/","prev":"best-wood-for-smoking-pork/","next":"prime-brisket-price/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["126537975","1898930737","1956324895","3147518746","333656818","3485313408"]}
