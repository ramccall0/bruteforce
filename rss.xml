----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PORK SHOULDER RESTING PERIOD
THE RESTING PERIOD FOR PORK SHOULDER IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN 3-12 HOURS. THIS DEPENDS HOW LARGE THE CUT IS IN WEIGHT AND THE STORAGE
METHOD OF RESTING. IF A PORK SHOULDER IS PUSHING AROUND 20 LBS, EXPECT TO HAVE IT REST CLOSER TO THE 8-12 HOUR MARK. A PORK
SHOULDER WEIGH IN AROUND 10 LBS, SHOULD ONLY REALLY REST ABOUT 3-8 HOURS.
Regarding the storage method that you could use for resting your pork shoulder after smoking or cooking it refers to placing it in
either an ice chest or warming oven. Not only that, but you should be considering wrapping your pork shoulder to further retain
the ambient and internal temperature within the meat. 

You would want to do this if you really want to let the meat rest for an extended period of time. 

For example, if you were wanting to perhaps serve it the next day - this can be a great option to still let the meat come down
over a longer period of time. Basically just a technique commonly used by experienced pit-masters.

In terms of the average cook, you will still want to take the right precautions and ALWAYS rest it in either one of those to
preferred storage methods.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN YOU PUT WARM PULLED PORK IN THE FRIDGE?
YOU CAN CERTAINLY PUT WARM PULLED PORK IN THE FRIDGE. ALTHOUGH, IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO PUT FRESH OFF THE SMOKER AND VERY HOT
PULLED PORK IN THE FRIDGE. YOU DON’T WANT EVERYTHING ELSE INSIDE TO WARM UP AND SPOIL.
When you pull your pulled pork shoulder off of the smoker, you don’t want to get ahead of yourself and take the wrong steps in
handling the post smoke process. 

Pulling your pulled pork off the smoker means you are ready to begin resting it. This can certainly be done in an ice
chest/warming oven like mentioned above, and you can even rest it long term in the fridge. The only caveat to this is, you will
want to let the pork shoulder rest at least 3 hours before even thinking about putting it in the fridge. Again, you don’t want the
ambient temperature inside the fridge to start rising and spoil all of the perishables inside.

The overall goal of resting an amazingly smoked pork shoulder is to let the internal temperatures come down to a reasonable level.
This is around 150-170. Some pork shoulders get to that quicker than others, and is mainly dependent on how you store them after
you smoke in addition to how large the cut of meat is.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN I OVERCOOK PORK SHOULDER?
YOU CAN CERTAINLY OVERCOOK A PORK SHOULDER. THIS USUALLY OCCURS WHEN YOU LET THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE RISE ABOVE 205 DEGREES
INTERNAL. YOU CAN ALSO DRY OUT A PULLED PORK SHOULDER BY PULLING IT BEFORE THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE HAS HAD AMPLE TIME TO STEAD
OUT AT AROUND 150-170 DEGREES.
Generally, there are two ways to discern whether or not if your pork shoulder is overcooked or undercooked:

 1. Over Cooked: 1. Pork shoulder pulls apart easily, but the strands are tough and stringy.
    
    
 2. Under Cooked: 1. Pork shoulder will be a really tough piece of meat that you can’t seem to pull apart.
    
    


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO YOU NOT OVERCOOK A PORK SHOULDER?
NOT OVERCOOKING A PORK SHOULDER IS EASY. SIMPLY MONITOR THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURES BEFORE PULLING OFF THE SMOKER - WHEN IT HITS
200-203 INTERNAL AND PROBES LIKE BUTTER - THEN LET IT REST FOR AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF TIME - 3-12 HOURS IN MOST CASES - AND ONLY PULL
THE MEAT APART WHEN THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE REACHES BETWEEN 150-170 DEGREES.
What seems to make people confused and unsure about their meats being smoked it usually due to the fact that they are either
impatient, or aren’t measure their temperatures appropriately.

Being impatient: 

When Pit-Masters go through the trouble of smoking their pork shoulder, I have seen many mess up at the last minute and simply
pull the meat way too quick. They usually think that since it has already been over 12 hours since the start of the cook, are
getting tired, are getting hungry, etc. that means they can just pull the thing off the smoker grates.

WRONG!

The last couple of miles in the cooking process are absolutely critical to ensuring an amazingly smoked pork shoulder. 

By being too impatient - you are sacrificing your entire smoke and basically wasting your time and hard work. You DON’T want that!

Not measuring the internal temperature correctly:

This is a huge topic, but essentially you just want to be using the right kind of temperature reading equipment. Get a quality
thermometer, stick it inside the thickest part of your pork shoulder, then let it start reading the temps.

Once you’re able to get a good read on the internal temperature for your pork shoulder - be sure to pull it at roughly 200-203
degrees internal. Do NOT pull the meat before this stage. Some people will say that the meat can possibly be done in the low
190’s, however I have yet to see that myself. 

When the temperature hits the famed 200-203 range, that is precisely when the collagen within the meat will begin to dissolve and
make the inside incredibly tender. 

That’s why when you not only have the internal temperature reading at 200 degrees, many experienced pit-masters will also advise
(myself included) to begin probing the meat with the thermometer to see if it’s like butter.]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/pulled-pork-rest-overnight/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/pulled-pork-rest-overnight/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 19:03:21 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Rest your pork shoulder overnight by pulling it off the smoker once the internal temperature hits at least 200 degrees, then wrap it in either foil of butcher paper, and place it in a storage container such as a ice chest or warming oven.

Pulled pork can rest in the oven or ice chest for about 8-12 hours. Anything longer - and you will have too cold of meat to serve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can pulled pork rest too long? - Table of Contents:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I do if my pork shoulder is done early?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long can I hold pork butt in oven?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I pull pork after it cools?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you keep a pork shoulder warm without drying it out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Pulled Pork better the next day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I do if my pork shoulder is done early?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You  need to take the pork shoulder off the smoker, and place it in either a warming oven or ice chest cooler.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you place your barbecue in either an ice chest or warming oven, you help to prolong the amount of time that it is holding warm. If your concern is that it is done too early, this can be a great method. It allows you to stop worrying about when your pork shoulder is finished, and how you can effectively serve it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, if a pork shoulder is done too early, you can be rest assured that by placing it in one of those two storage methods, it can safely sit in there for 8-12 hours. This alone opens up a lot of possibilities for other cooks, as now you can start planning your cooks better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long can I hold pork butt in oven?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You can hold pork butt in an oven for roughly 8-12 hours. This will keep the ambient and internal temperatures steady.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When choosing to hold your pork butt in an oven, you can have a clean and effective way to make sure your barbecue comes out simply amazing. It’s also recommended to wrap the pork butt in either foil or butcher paper to ensure the temperature will hold even longer. You don’t have to wrap it, since the oven can hold the ambient temperatures just fine - it’s just a pit-master pro tip if you really want to start holding it for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also want to pay close attention to how large the city of pork butt is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s one of those monster 20lbs pork butts, then expect to let it rest in the oven closer to the end of the 12 hour resting range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the pork butt is hovering around 9-10lbs, then you don’t really have to let it rest for over 12 hours (although you certainly could). My recommendation: let it rest for 3-6 hours in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table showcasing pork butt weight correlated with resting time in oven:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Pork Butt Weight&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Resting time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10lbs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3-6 hours&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;20lbs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6-12 hours&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I pull pork after it cools?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You want to pull pork when it cools. This will ensure that no moisture is lost after the cooking period. Make sure the internal temperature is between 150 - 160 degrees.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you let a pork rest and the internal temperature comes down to between 150-160 degrees internal, the end product will be awesome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the worst mistakes you can make when smoking a pork shoulder is pulling it way too soon. Doing so will ruin your cook and the meat will be completely dry. You won’t be able to eat it. Therefore, it is always recommended to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull Pork Shoulder Off Smoker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place in storage container - ice chest/warming oven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let rest until 150 - 160 degrees internal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull/shred pork shoulder after if cools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you decide to let the pork shoulder rest inside a refrigerator - you probably won’t want to try to shred/pull it after it has cooled way down. All of the fat inside and around the meat itself at that point has solidified and you will be hard pressed to try and shred everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you keep a pork shoulder warm without drying it out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;To keep a pork shoulder warm without drying it out you will want to pull it off the smoker, wrap it in foil/butcher paper, then place it in either a warming oven. Do not increase any ambient temperatures, and let the pork shoulder rest. You will be fine leaving it for up to 12 hours.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it OK to leave it covered in the oven at around 150 all day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. By letting a pork shoulder sit in a warming oven all day at an ambient temp of around 150 degrees - you are keeping the environment hot enough to never let the pork shoulder go cold, but low enough to let the hot internal temperature come down to a more reasonable amount. Usually, if you  follow the above advice - you will never have a tough or dry pork shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One word of caution when storing your pork shoulder - it is absolutely critical to ensure that you pull the meat off the smoker at the right temps! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When in doubt, follow these steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull Pork shoulder off the pit at around 200 - 204 degrees internal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure it is PROBE TENDER before pulling off the smoker racks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place it in a pan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrap in foil or butcher paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place in storage container - ice cooler or warming oven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait roughly 8-12 hours to let the internal temps come down&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is Pulled pork better the next day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulled pork can be better the next day. You have to make sure to take the right steps to ensure it comes out just as good fresh. Pull the pork shoulder at 200 degrees internal, and let it rest for a long enough time of 8-12 hours. When you reheat the pulled pork the next day - it will taste amazing and be incredibly tender.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a large gathering on a certain day - and are inquiring about whether you can time the smoking of your pork shoulder ahead of time - you certainly can. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is budget when your company is coming over. From that point, budget roughly another 24 hours to account for total smoking and resting time for your pork shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When serving pulled pork the next day - you have two options:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plan ahead, not refrigerate, and hold the pork shoulder in an ice chest/warming oven for 12 hours before serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take an extra couple steps, and simply place the pork shoulder in the fridge, then appropriately reheat it a few hours before your company arrives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing either of these methods will ensure that your pork shoulder will be very moist, tender, and tasty. That is all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are wondering how this applies to brisket, read here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-card-container&quot; href=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/is-smoked-brisket-good-the-next-day/&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;bookmark-title&quot;&gt;Is smoked brisket good the next day? | YES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;bookmark-description&quot;&gt;Smoked brisket is amazing when served the next day.

DOES COSTCO SELL PICANHA?
Costco definitely sells Picanha. If you are looking to buy one, you need to go to the meat section. Take a look in the bins, and
examine the contents. You will find all kinds of cryo-vacuumed sealed bags with tons of meat in them.

They come in packages of around two to three actual Picanha’s per bag. The price per pound for prime Picanha at Costco is roughly
$6.69/lb. That can be a great bargain when shopping for some awesome meat.

Here’s a picture of what they look like:

Picanha at Costco - Top Sirloin CapThe only downside to buying a Picanha at Costco is that the Picanha Cuts you get in these
vacuumed sealed bags is actually just the meat itself - with the fat cap removed!

If you want a Picanha with a great, juicy fat cap on top - you will need to head on over to the meat counter and promptly ask one
of the meat butchers to provide you with the following: 

> Sirloin cap steak with the fat cap on


This will indicate to them that you want a Picanha with the fat cap still in tact. Personally, I LOVE having the fat cap on my
Picanha’s.

If you DON’T want the fat cap on your Picanha when shopping at Costco - then you can just go back to the meat bins and pick up:

> Beef Loin Top Sirloin Cap 


This one will just be the Picanha without the fat cap in tact.

COSTCO PICANHA PRICE?
Picanha at Costco comes in a variety of prices, determined primarily through the grade you are selecting. 

Here’s a list of Prices for Picanha when buying it at Costco:

WHERE CAN I FIND PICANHA MEAT?
Since we’re talking about buying Picanha at Costco - all you need to do is head over to either the meat counter and ask the
butcher for a cut, or to walk over to the meat bin with the sealed bags. 

If you don’t have a Costco nearby - don’t worry. Just follow the same process as mentioned above at your local grocery store and
try to see if they have availability.

One of the things I’ve noticed about buying Picanha at Costco and other grocery stores - you generally have to ask multiple people
in order to find someone who actually knows what you’re talking about.

> Can you ask this in store or do you need to order ahead?


You don’t need to call ahead - generally speaking - since Picanha is really not that well known anyways. Therefore, since there
isn’t that much competition for getting that particular cut of meat - you can usually just show up and pick one up on the spot.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IS PICANHA A GOOD CUT?
Picanha is an amazing cut of meat. It’s a traditionally selected form of serving meat in Brazil - and is better known by the
preparation method. Specifically, it is served Churrascaria style. 

For more information on what the different Picanha Cuts are:

WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PICANHA CUTS? What are the different Picanha Cuts? There are three main Picanha Cuts. Individual Picanha
Steaks, Picanha Roast, and Brazilian Churrascaria. BBQ DropoutWhen buying the Picanha Cut at Costco - it can come out amazingly
well. That is due to the fact that most of the meat you will find in Costco is tenderized, and has excellent marbling quality. 

The marbling quality is simply a result of the grades you are selecting. Prime and Choice grade Picanha at Costco is among the
most popular types you will find.

Since the Picanha at Costco doesn’t have a fat cap - some people claim that you don’t need one anyways just because of the
excellent quality of the meat with regards to the marbling. 

Speaking of marbling, check this out:

cap still in tact!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY IS PICANHA NOT POPULAR?
Picanha is not that popular because it is traditionally a Brazilian style of preparing meat. That means since it’s a foreign cut
of meat - not that many people in the States will actually know what it even is. 

The one’s that do know what Picanah is are generally those who either frequent one of the many Brazilian steakhouses around the
U.S. or they are barbecue connoisseur’s much like myself!

This will ensure that the metal integrity is sustained. You do NOT want to neglect this as your smoker firebox would begin to rust, and ultimately start eroding the metal.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you season the firebox on a smoker? | YOUTUBE VIDEO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;youTube-J2hwSwNQ9wM&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2hwSwNQ9wM&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you season the firebox on a smoker?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Table of  Contents:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you Season the Firebox on a Smoker?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often do you re-season your offset firebox?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you Season the Firebox on a Smoker?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You absolutely season the firebox on a smoker. Before you start applying oil and heat to seal the metal - you will want to begin cleaning all the ash and residual particles out of the inside of the firebox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth taking a look at the YouTube video of BBQDROPOUT explaining his process on cleaning out the Offset Smoker Firebox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, it is very apparent how important it is to season and clean out your firebox for your smoker. To get started, you will need two primary pieces of equipment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shovel to scoop all material out of the smoker firebox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash Bucket to capture all the material you are scooping out of the smoker firebox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shovel to scoop all material out of the smoker firebox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step is pretty easy. All you have to do is grab a shovel that is relatively short in length to allow for easy holding. Easy holding meaning - you can hold the shovel with one hand. This will allow you to position objects in the smoker firebox with one hand, while scooping them out with the shovel in the other hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes the process of cleaning the smoker firebox extremely easy and efficient!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the grates of your smoker firebox and take out any placement metal commonly used to hoist the wood on top of. Once all the main metal and residual tools are out, you can simply start scraping all throughout the firebox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there will be hard chunks that will be difficult to scrape out. Don’t be afraid to really hammer the metal - this thing is solid steel after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash Bucket to Capture all the material you are scooping out of the smoker firebox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have your handheld shovel and are scooping out all of the ash and burnt wood - make sure to have your ash bucket ready at the bottom end of the firebox. That way you wont have to manually scoop and walk over to a nearby trash can. It’s all about efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size and scope of your ash bucket can be any size you are comfortable with. I just got one from my local grocery store - HEB - and it is quite big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will allow for some amazing scooping of ash out of my Smoker Firebox!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you are about done scraping and scooping all the ash into your ash bucket - feel free to empty the bucket. Don’t get into the habit of leaving it there. I’ve done that many times and before you know it - your ash bucket will start to rust! Definitely don’t want that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have a habit of leaving your equipment out in the elements - especially when it is filled with ash and other left over material - rain will eventually come and you don’t want your ash bucket to become filled with ash and water. It is not a good combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want an in-depth tutorial for how to clean an offset smoker:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-card-container&quot; href=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/how-to-clean-offset-smoker/&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;bookmark-title&quot;&gt;How to clean offset smoker?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;bookmark-description&quot;&gt;Learn how to effectively clean an offset smoker!

This method can be applied directly to any cast iron style smoker - not strictly an offset smoker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways - you definitely will want to make sure not only do you clean your smoker firebox but season it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To properly season your offset firebox - you will want to ensure it is clean - as per the above method where you get your handheld shovel and ash bucket - grab a jar of oil or a can of oil spray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have obtained oil that is easy to apply - go ahead and start spraying and applying the oil all over the outside AND inside. This step is crucial - since both sides are affected by rust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the Exterior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quick Re-Cap:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve covered som pretty good ground in this article:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you season the firebox on a smoker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often do you re-season your offset firebox?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding whether or not you should season your smoker firebox -  the answer is always yes. You just simply don’t want to have the metal quality eroded overtime and have all your money paying for the pit, go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further you don’t want to stop at just the first seasoning session for your firebox - always make sure to keep it in your toolkit and routing whenever you think about using your smoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;following all of this advice will not only preserve the life of your smoker pit, but will certainly provide you with amazing barbecue every time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is prime brisket worth the money? | ABSOLUTELY ]]></title><description><![CDATA[PRIME BRISKET IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY. ALTHOUGH MORE EXPENSIVE, IT CAN COOK FASTER, HAS A HIGHER MARBLING CONTENT THAN
CHOICE OR SELECT GRADES, AND MAKES FOR AN AMAZING AFTER PRODUCT.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY IS BRISKET SO EXPENSIVE?
BRISKET IN GENERAL CAN BE A FAIRLY EXPENSIVE CUT OF MEAT SIMPLY DUE TO ITS’ SIZE. USUALLY, A SINGLE BRISKET PACKER WILL WEIGH
ANYWHERE FROM 10-25LBS. THAT’S A LOT OF MEAT. EVEN THOUGH THE BRISKET PRICE PER POUND IS RELATIVELY LOW - THE SHEER SIZE OF THE
CUT IS WHAT MAKES THE PRICE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE.
A lot of the actual price per pound of a particular brisket also revolves around supply and demand, like everything else. There
could be a cattle shortage, an increase in demand for beef, the list goes on. 

Generally though in Texas - the Price per pound of prime grade brisket has never gone above $3.99. 

For ‘lesser’ grades of brisket - it could be as low as $1.99 per pound for select and somewhere in between for choice grade
brisket.

Let’s take an example of obtaining a giant, 20lb piece of brisket, and compare it against different prices for the different
grades I’ve seen:

Prime Brisket Price:


20lb X $3.99 = $79.80


$79.80 for a 20lb piece of meat may sound like a lot, but it’s 20lbs of meat! That’s a lot of meat to consume. Brisket can be
great for eating throughout the week - or perhaps cooking for a large event. Imagine trying to cook 20lbs of rib eye. That would
be tremendously more expensive than this.

Not only do you get a great bang for your buck - but the entire 20lbs of meat is prime grade quality. You really can’t beat that.

Choice Brisket Price:


20lb X $2.99 = $59.80


$59.80 for a 20lb piece of meat is certainly not bad either! Choice can be another great way to accommodate a large gathering or
serve as the primary food for your entire week. The marbling isn’t as good as prime - but you can still save some extra money
while consuming a very tasty piece of barbecue.

Select Brisket Price:


20lb X $1.99 = $39.80


Can you imagine getting roughly 20lbs of meat for only $39.80? That’s what you can get with Select Grade Brisket. That being said
- with Select - you really have to consider that there’s probably a reason why it is so cheap. Generally, Select Grade Brisket is
a lot leaner than both choice and prime. That means it is a lot more prone to being dry, tough, and not as tender. 

Still though, any grade of brisket can come out great if you are an excellent pit master.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHICH IS BETTER FLAT OR POINT BRISKET?
IT DEPENDS IF YOU LIKE EATING A FATTY OR LEAN PIECE OF MEAT. FOR BBQ DROPOUT - POINT BRISKET IS THE WAY TO GO. THE POINT OF THE
BRISKET WILL LITERALLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.
When you smoke your brisket - you will want to separate the point from the flat eventually. You do this when you are slicing - and
there’s even a whole technique to it. 

When deciding which to eat - or which is better - let’s take a look at the profile of each part of the brisket.

Flat Part of the Brisket

The flat portion of the brisket is by far the leanest. It is also the most prone to the common pitfalls of smoking and slicing a
brisket - drying out. This is a very delicate part of the brisket, and it needs some special attention.

Despite the special attention it may deserve - the taste and flavor profile can still be very rewarding. Most people seem to like
leaner types of meat - and the flat part of the brisket can be a great option. It has the right amount of beefy flavor,
tenderness, and leanness.

Point Part of the Brisket

The point portion of the brisket is my absolute favorite! The reasoning for this is simply because it’s like biting into the
juiciest steak imaginable. The entire portion of the point part of the brisket just melts in your mouth - if it was cooked
correctly.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOES A PRIME BRISKET COOK FASTER?
I HAVE SEEN PRIME BRISKETS COOK FASTER THAN OTHER LESSER GRADES SUCH AS CHOICE AND SELECT. MY THEORY IS SIMPLY DUE TO THE FACT
THAT A PRIME BRISKET WILL GENERALLY HAVE MORE MARBLING - AND THEREFORE LESS CONNECTIVE TISSUE TO RENDER DOWN. THIS SIGNIFICANTLY
SPEEDS UP THE COOK.
When smoking a brisket you are rendering down all of the collagen and connective tissue inside the meat. That is why you may hear
a lot of people say you need to be pulling the brisket not only when the internal temperature is around 200 degrees AND it probes
tender. That’s when the brisket is truly done.

This effect can be expedited with prime briskets.

Usually what happens is a prime brisket has more overall marbling and fat content and perhaps not as much muscle or connective
tissue to render down. Fat is a lot easier to render down than all of those really tough connective tissues!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRISKET COOKING TOO FAST?
BRISKET CAN COOK TOO FAST IF YOU HAVE IT WRAPPED, ARE COOKING IT TOO HOT, OR YOU ARE SMOKING WITH A QUALITY GRADE SUCH AS PRIME.
If your brisket does happen to find itself cooking too fast, there are a variety of things you could consider doing:

 * Decrease the smoker temps to help prolong the cook
 * Unwrap the brisket if it is wrapped 
 * Place the brisket in a cooler or warming oven to prolong the holding and resting time

Once you have exhausted all of these options - you just have to accept your fate! 

However, is having a brisket really all that bad? Most of the time it smokes for 12 or more hours, but if you’re in a time crunch
anyways - it’s not the end of the world.

They are all different. Every brisket is not the same and you have to learn how to adjust accordingly.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRIME VS CHOICE BRISKET?
PRIME IS BETTER THAN CHOICE IF YOU WANT A WELL MARBLED, FATTIER, AND MORE TENDER CUT OF BRISKET. IF YOU WANT A SLIGHTLY MORE LEAN
TYPE OF BRISKET THEN GRAB A CHOICE GRADE BRISKET.
Like everything else in life - don’t trap yourself by dogma. Basically, you don’t always have to be getting the ‘best’ grade of
brisket out there. Lot’s of people will ONLY grab prime ‘just because’ and that’s not the way to do it. 

As a pit master - use your head - are prime briskets REALLY all that good?

Yeah, they are really good. But sometimes people want something different - and that’s okay!

ALL THIS BEING SAID - LET’S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIME AND CHOICE BRISKET:
Prime Brisket:

 * Much more marbling
 * More forgiving to cook (due to marbling)
 * Not as lean as choice or select
 * More expensive ($3.99/lb)

Choice Brisket:

 * Not as much marbling as prime
 * Good balance between too fatty and too lean
 * Not as forgiving as prime when cooking (lack of marbling)
 * Less Expensive ($2.99lb)

As you can see - when you actually break down the data and stray away from being too abstract - there are very few differences
between the two grades of brisket.

It really boils down to if you want to pay more for a more fattier type of brisket that can tolerate a little more beating in the
cooking process. That’s it.

SELECT BRISKET VS PRIME?
SELECT BRISKET IS MORE LEAN THAN PRIME, WHILE PRIME BRISKET IS WAY MORE MARBLED.
What really matters when deciding between the two is how skilled you are at maintaining consistent temperatures throughout the
cooking process and if you want a leaner or fattier brisket.

LET’S BREAK THIS ONE DOWN:
Select Brisket

 * Not as forgiving as choice or prime brisket (lack of marbling)
 * Cheaper than both choice and prime brisket ($1.99/lb)
 * A lot more lean than both choice and prime brisket
 * Requires more Pit Master Skill to cook properly (due to leanness)

Prime Brisket

 * A lot more forgiving than select and choice grade brisket (more marbling)
 * More expensive than both select and choice ($3.99/lb)
 * Not as lean and is more tender than both select and choice
 * Does not require as much Pit Master skill to cook properly (due to marbling)

What it boils down to regarding prime vs select brisket is the amount of skill you have in smoking a brisket. The select brisket
is a lot more prone to drying out than prime brisket and therefore requires much more attention than a prime grade brisket.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IS PRIME BRISKET WORTH THE MONEY - FINAL THOUGHTS:
Prime brisket is worth the money if you have the budget to pay a little extra for an easier to cook piece of meat. Otherwise - go
with choice or select if you don’t have the budget but have the required pit master skills to properly cook a brisket.]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/is-prime-brisket-worth-the-money/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/is-prime-brisket-worth-the-money/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 13:18:50 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Prime brisket is absolutely worth the money.

Often times with barbecue, you will need to rest the
piece of meat for just as long as the actual cook takes. For pork shoulder, that means resting it for roughly 8-12 hours. This
simply lets the internal temperatures stabilize, and for all of the moisture inside the meat to replenish. If you don’t let a pork
shoulder rest after smoking - you will absolutely have a dry piece of meat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN YOU LET A PORK SHOULDER REST OVERNIGHT?
You can certainly let a pork shoulder rest overnight. In fact, it is highly recommended. The reason why you would want to rest a
pork shoulder overnight is comprised of multiple points:

 * Time you started your cook
 * Length of Cook
 * How large the pork shoulder is
 * Method of storing the pork shoulder
 * Estimated Serving time

These are just some general high level points to keep in mind that factor into why you should let a pork shoulder rest overnight. 

Let’s dig into some of them.

TIME YOU STARTED YOUR COOK
When you start smoking your pork shoulder: 

> Are you starting in the wee-hours of the morning?

Are you starting in the afternoon?

Starting the cook in the evening?


The time that you start smoking your pork shoulder is one of the most important qualities of the cook, and directly determines
when you will potentially have to serve the meat. 

Remember - these cooks last anywhere from 8-12 hours OR LONGER. 

If you start smoking your pork shoulder in the wee-hours of the morning - let’s say about 5am - you could estimate that you will
finish at roughly 5-6pm in the evening, and that’s being generous. 

Let’s quickly factor that time frame into the other two sub categories.

If you are smoking a pork shoulder in the middle of the afternoon - expect to have the cook finish right at midnight. 

And if you’re starting the cook in the evening - well, you are going to be up all night long!

We’ve quickly covered the points of when you will potentially have to start your cook, and how long it can take. Now, let’s
consider how large of a pork shoulder you’re smoking.

A pork shoulder generally weighs anywhere from 10-20lbs, and a general rule of thumb to follow regarding how to estimate cook time
is to count 1 hour of cook time per pound of meat. That means for a 15lb pork shoulder smoked at the standard 225 degrees - could
take over 15 hours! That is a huge factor that directly impacts how long you will be smoking your meat and by default - how long
you will rest the pork shoulder. 

Once you consider when you start your actual cooking and how much the pork shoulder weighs - consider how you will begin to rest
it.

For starters, there are a variety of methods I like to use for storing barbecue, and I cover some of them here for brisket:

CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? | BBQ DROPOUT’S TAKE Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being
said, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too short a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you
let brisket rest the right way, you can rest assured that the results will be amazing e… BBQ DropoutThe principles are the same,
and you want to either store your pork shoulder in a faux cambro (ice chest) or an oven with a warming feature. 

This can help prolong your resting if you need to serve at a specific time, or if you just want to have a way to control the
ambient temperature - which let’s the internal temps of your pork shoulder come down nice and steady. Having your temps come down
steady is a good thing, since you don’t want a lot of random fluctuations affecting your meat that you can’t control.

Alright, now we’ve covered all of that - let’s take a quick look at why a pork shoulder takes so long to smoke!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY DOES PULLED PORK TAKE SO LONG?
Pork shoulder can take a substantially longer amount of time to not only smoke/cook, but to rest. The reasoning behind this is
just due to the sheer size of the meat. Not only that, but when you place it off the smoker - it is raging hot. All of that meat,
protein, fat, and moisture is moving around inside and will promptly dry out if you cut into it too soon. 

Furthermore, with larger cuts such as pork shoulder - you will encounter something known as “the stall”. This is where the
internal temperature hits around 150-17o degrees internal, staying at that exact measure for hours on end. There’s a whole science
behind why that happens, but for simplicities sake - just keep smoking the meat - it will eventually progress through this
stalling phase. 

For those interested - basically what happens is the meat starts to sweat and actually cools down the meat. This seemingly
prolongs the cooking process to several more hours and can certainly frustrate people that are new to barbecuing. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT TEMPERATURE SHOULD I REST PULLED PORK?
The temperature you should rest pulled pork should be when the pork shoulder reaches above 200 degrees internal. That can be a
great way to indicate when the cook should come to an end. Even though you pull your pork shoulder off the smoker - that’s only
half the battle!

Regarding the temperature on when you should rest and pull it apart - that is generally anywhere from 150-160 degrees internal. 

Whatever you do - DO NOT PULL THE PORK UNTIL IT HITS AT LEAST 160 DEGREES INTERNAL!

If you make the mistake of tearing apart your pork shoulder before the temperature stabilizes to around 150-160 degrees - you will
be certain to have an unfortunately dry amount of pulled pork.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW LONG CAN YOU LET A PORK SHOULDER REST?
The recommended length of time to let a pork shoulder rest is between 8-12 hours. This should give it ample time to come down in
internal temperature.

You don’t want to rest a pork shoulder longer than that time frame. Any longer, and you will risk either drying out the meat or
rendering it too cold to serve. If you are trying to just let it rest for the purpose of letting all the moisture settle down
inside - then it’s alright if you let it rest a little longer than 12 hours. 

Letting the pork shoulder rest longer than 12 hours should mean to you that it is headed straight to the fridge - otherwise it
will not be able to be served appropriately. Once you place it in the fridge for further resting, feel free to heat it back up to
the desired internal temperature - then start serving it. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN PULLED PORK REST TOO LONG?
It sure can! 

Check out this article where I cover how long is too long for resting pulled pork:

CAN PULLED PORK REST TOO LONG? | NO LONGER THAN 12 HOURS! Every piece of meat can rest too long. Pulled pork can rest in the oven
or ice chest for about 8-12 hours. Anything longer - and you will have too cold of meat to serve.

Often times with barbecue, you will need to rest the piece of meat for just as long as the actual cook takes. For pork shoulder, that means resting it for roughly 8-12 hours. This simply lets the internal temperatures stabilize, and for all of the moisture inside the meat to replenish. If you don’t let a pork shoulder rest after smoking - you will absolutely have a dry piece of meat.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How long do you let a pork shoulder rest after smoking - Table of Contents:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you let a pork shoulder rest overnight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does pulled pork take so long?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What temperature should I rest pulled pork?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long can you let a pork shoulder rest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can pulled pork rest too long?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you let a pork shoulder rest overnight?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can certainly let a pork shoulder rest overnight. In fact, it is highly recommended. The reason why you would want to rest a pork shoulder overnight is comprised of multiple points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time you started your cook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Length of Cook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How large the pork shoulder is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method of storing the pork shoulder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimated Serving time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just some general high level points to keep in mind that factor into why you should let a pork shoulder rest overnight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig into some of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Time you started your cook&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you start smoking your pork shoulder: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you starting in the wee-hours of the morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you starting in the afternoon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting the cook in the evening?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time that you start smoking your pork shoulder is one of the most important qualities of the cook, and directly determines when you will potentially have to serve the meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember - these cooks last anywhere from 8-12 hours OR LONGER. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you start smoking your pork shoulder in the wee-hours of the morning - let’s say about 5am - you could estimate that &lt;strong&gt;you will finish at roughly 5-6pm in the evening&lt;/strong&gt;, and that’s being generous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s quickly factor that time frame into the other two sub categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are smoking a pork shoulder in the middle of the afternoon - expect to have the cook finish right at midnight.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And if you’re starting the cook in the evening - well, you are going to be up all night long!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve quickly covered the points of when you will potentially have to start your cook, and how long it can take. Now, let’s consider how large of a pork shoulder you’re smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pork shoulder generally weighs anywhere from 10-20lbs&lt;/strong&gt;, and a general rule of thumb to follow regarding how to estimate cook time is to &lt;strong&gt;count 1 hour of cook time per pound of meat. That means for a 15lb pork shoulder smoked at the standard 225 degrees - could take over 15 hours!&lt;/strong&gt; That is a huge factor that directly impacts how long you will be smoking your meat and by default - how long you will rest the pork shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you consider when you start your actual cooking and how much the pork shoulder weighs - consider how you will begin to rest it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, there are a variety of methods I like to use for storing barbecue, and I cover some of them here for brisket:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-card-container&quot; href=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/can-brisket-rest-too-long/&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;bookmark-title&quot;&gt;Can brisket rest too long? | BBQ DROPOUT’S TAKE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;bookmark-description&quot;&gt;Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being said, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too
short a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you let brisket rest the right way, you can rest
assured that the results will be amazing e…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/icons/icon-512x512.png?v=040e94e31df278aecae934ec416b79ee&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bookmark-author&quot;&gt;BBQ Dropout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;min-width:33.3%&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-thumbnail flex-grow&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; src=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/static/a3c53b6587344eb885079e5ea3dfecca/cover_1619658702735.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principles are the same, and you want to either store your pork shoulder in a faux cambro (ice chest) or an oven with a warming feature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can help prolong your resting  if you need to serve at a specific time, or if you just want to have a way to control the ambient temperature - which let’s the internal temps of your pork shoulder come down nice and steady. Having your temps come down steady is a good thing, since you don’t want a lot of random fluctuations affecting your meat that you can’t control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, now we’ve covered all of that - let’s take a quick look at why a pork shoulder takes so long to smoke!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does pulled pork take so long?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pork shoulder can take a substantially longer amount of time to not only smoke/cook, but to rest. The reasoning behind this is just due to the sheer size of the meat. Not only that, but when you place it off the smoker - it is raging hot. All of that meat, protein, fat, and moisture is moving around inside and will promptly dry out if you cut into it too soon.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore,  with larger cuts such as pork shoulder - you will encounter something known as “the stall”. This is where  the internal temperature hits around 150-17o degrees internal, staying at that exact measure for hours on end.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT TEMP TO SLICE BRISKET AFTER RESTING?
WHEN YOU ARE SLICING BRISKET - MAKE SURE TO ONLY SLICE INTO IT WHEN IT IS TEMPING OUT AT AROUND 150 - 170 DEGREES INTERNAL.
ANYTHING HIGHER THAN 170 DEGREES, AND YOU RISK HAVING ALL THE MOISTURE DRAIN AND DRY YOUR BRISKET OUT.
When you think about it, slicing a brisket is a very critical part of the overall cooking process. You go through the effort of
prepping your pit, seasoning the meat, and smoking the thing for well over 12 hours. 

Little do some people know - that if you don’t heed the advice I just laid out - slicing in the temperature range of 150 - 170
degrees internal - you will make all of that incredible effort go to waste. 

That is why you need to become better informed on how a brisket can react to certain stimuli. Stimuli in this case meaning slicing
the brisket.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SHOULD YOU SLICE LEFTOVER BRISKET?
YOU SHOULD IDEALLY SLICE THE BRISKET ONLY WHEN NEEDED. IF THE BRISKET IS TO BE SERVED ALL AT ONCE, THEN YOU SHOULD SLICE AS YOU
ARE SERVING. IF YOU HAVE INTENTIONS ON SECONDS - THEN YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WAIT TO SLICE THE BRISKET.
Brisket is such a finicky piece of meat when it comes to serving. It is very prone to drying out, which is why it is touted as one
of the hardest cuts of barbecue to get just right.

Don’t worry though - just follow along in all of my posts and you will have great brisket every time!

When you are ready to begin slicing your brisket - like mentioned above - you need to slice only when necessary. You don’t need to
slice the whole thing at once. That means when you are finished smoking and resting the brisket - ask yourself when you need to
eat it?

If you can wait to eat it and need to slice at a later time, that’s completely fine. 

If you are wanting to eat perhaps a small portion of the brisket - then you will want to try to only begin slicing the brisket
areas that you intend to actually eat on the spot. Everything else can stay in tact. Again, this can be crucial to making sure all
left overs are adequately taken care of and you don’t get a nasty and dry piece of meat.

Not only will it be dry and dull - but you will be very frustrated with a lackluster product despite spending 12 hours or more
cooking it. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN YOU SLICE BRISKET COLD?
YOU CAN SLICE BRISKET COLD. BE AWARE THOUGH, THAT IF YOU DO THIS AND ATTEMPT TO REHEAT THE SLICES INDIVIDUALLY - YOU ARE GREATLY
INCREASING THE CHANCES THE SLICES WILL COME OUT DRY. IF YOU CHOOSE NOT SLICE THE BRISKET PIECES COLD - AND INSTEAD ONLY CUT INTO
YOUR BRISKET WHEN YOU’RE READY TO SERVE RIGHT THEN AND THERE - THEN YOU WILL MOST LIKELY END UP WITH AN AMAZING END PRODUCT.
Usually, when smoking a brisket and deciding to either rest it down to a reasonable internal temperature for serving - or putting
it in the fridge for slicing cold and serving later - the option to only slice the brisket when necessary is the better option.

Sliced brisket, when left uneaten will dry out almost immediately. That is again why you will commonly hear pit masters say that
when you do actually slice your brisket - to keep all the slices still compacted together so the juices and moisture doesn’t
evaporate away. 

If you don’t follow that advice, rest assured you will end up with a distasteful brisket slice. 

All this to say - you certainly can slice a brisket cold if you so wish, and here’s how to do it and make sure that you’re slices
don’t dry out:

 * Slice the brisket cold and hold the individual slices inside a pan of the juices left over from the cook. Basically - the best
   way to hold brisket slices is to hold them in what’s known as an jus. You can think of it as the brisket’s beef broth. It keeps
   it moist, tender, and ensures a great flavor throughout. This will also make sure that whenever you decide to serve these slice
   - they will be dripping all over!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN YOU SLICE BRISKET THE NEXT DAY?
You can slice brisket the next day. Make sure that the internal temperature is roughly around 150 degrees. This will ensure a
great, warm, and tender product.

You need to be asking yourself what your overall goal is if you were to slice the brisket the next day. Also - you should be
asking yourself what the current situation is that makes you consider such a question.

When you smoke a brisket - depending how hot you decide to cook it at - you will find that the entire process takes at least 12
hours no matter what you do. The process of cooking usually takes that time alone - plus any amount of resting you do. My
recommendation is to rest a brisket as long as humanly possible, just to ensure all moisture content has come to a halt
temperature wise. You do this to prevent any from evaporating when the meat is way too hot and you slice into it.

All of this being considered - you may very likely find yourself in the position to begin slicing the brisket the next day. That’s
completely fine, just make sure you are resting it appropriately. 

When decide to slice the brisket the next day - if you take the appropriate resting methods to heart AND you pulled it off the
smoker at the right time (internal temps around 200 while probing tender), you will rest assured that your brisket slices are
going to come out amazing. 

Upon slicing your brisket the next day - make sure that each slice is still compacted together - meaning don’t start handing them
out until necessary and make sure to keep all slices sitting together. This helps to ensure that the moisture doesn’t evaporate
and dry each of them out.]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/what-temp-to-slice-brisket/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/what-temp-to-slice-brisket/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 01:03:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The temp that you want to slice a brisket at is anywhere between 150-170 degrees internal.

HOW DO YOU REHEAT SMOKED BRISKET THE NEXT DAY?
YOU CAN REHEAT SMOKED BRISKET THE NEXT DAY IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS. YOU CAN LET IT SIT IN YOUR HOLDING DEVICE - AN ICE
CHEST OR OVEN - WITHOUT PUTTING IT INTO A FRIDGE AND SIMPLY JUST PLACE IT INTO THE OVEN OR SMOKER AGAIN TO LET THE INTERNAL HEAT
CRANK BACK UP TO AROUND 150 DEGREES INTERNAL.
By doing this, you don’t have to wait for your brisket to thaw out essentially from being in a much colder environment for so long
by being in the fridge. If you do try to just throw it back on the smoker, or oven though - make sure the brisket hasn’t been
resting for more than 12 hours. Anything longer than 12 hours, and you risk the meat getting too cold at which point it’s best to
place it in the fridge.

PRO TIP:

Don’t slice into the brisket until absolutely necessary! 

It’s a lot easier to get a tender and moist brisket when reheating a whole compacted one, rather than heating up individual
slices. Don’t believe me? Salt Lick BBQ out in Driftwood, TX does this. They have found that the briskets come out even more
tender when reheating the next day.

Another crazy tip you could employ:

Try to save all the juices from the smoker, left over from the brisket smoke.

Place the brisket unwrapped on-top of all the juices, then let it reheat and baste over a low heat until ready to serve.

> Could this be done in the oven? Took a while to reheat all with one crock pot


This method can absolutely be done in the oven. Just place both the broth and juices in a large metal container, then place the
brisket inside. 

Place the heat on 250 degrees ambient temperature and you’ll be on your way to an amazing reheated brisket!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO YOU SERVE BRISKET THE NEXT DAY?
You can serve brisket the next day by smoking the brisket a day in advance, and letting the brisket rest overnight to ensure that
it will be ready for the next day. To prolong the resting time - wrap the brisket in foil or butcher paper - then place it into an
ice chest or oven to let it sit overnight.

What you can do to time the cook appropriately is to ask yourself when you will be wanting to serve the next day (doesn’t have to
be an exact time - just an estimate).

Then ask yourself when is a reasonable time for you to actually start cooking the meat.

Once you identify when you need to be serving - and an estimate of when you should start the cook, fire up that smoker!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW LONG CAN A BRISKET REST AFTER SMOKING?
Let brisket rest between 3-12 hours. When letting a brisket rest for that amount of time - you let the collagen, juices, and heat
to all come to a screeching halt. It will ensure that the end product for your brisket is nice and juicy.

 The method above briefly describes how to serve the brisket the next day. You will want to make sure that no matter how or when
you are serving your brisket, always let it rest. 

I can’t tell you how many briskets I’ve give mine through, and when I didn’t let them rest properly - they were all dry.

Every single one of them!

HOW DO YOU STORE SMOKED BRISKET OVERNIGHT?
STORE YOUR BRISKET OVER NIGHT BY TAKING IT OFF THE SMOKER, WRAPPING IT IN EITHER BUTCHER PAPER OR FOIL, THEN PLACE IT IN A WARMING
OVEN OR ICE CHEST COOLER.
When resting a smoked brisket overnight - make sure to not open any of the doors to the oven/ice cooler. This will let heat escape
and possibly make the brisket come down to temps way too fast. Specifically, you don’t want your internal temperatures to dip
below 150 degrees. This is why placing it in a preferred storage container is important. 

> What is a preferred storage container for resting smoked brisket overnight?


All that means is storing your brisket inside of an ice chest/cooler or a warming oven. 

When you take this approach, you can rest assured that your brisket will not dip in temperature too fast - the ambient and
internal temperatures will become steady and start to decrease a lot slower than otherwise noted.

You can let it sit in your holding device - an ice chest or oven - without putting it into a fridge and simply just place it into the oven or smoker again to let the internal heat crank back up to around 150 degrees internal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By doing this, you don’t have to wait for your brisket to thaw out essentially from being in a much colder environment for so long by being in the fridge. If you do try to just throw it back on the smoker, or oven though - make sure the brisket hasn’t been resting for more than 12 hours.  Anything longer than 12 hours, and you risk the meat getting too cold at which point it’s best to place it in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO TIP:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t slice into the brisket until absolutely necessary! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot easier to get a tender and moist brisket when reheating a whole compacted one, rather than heating up individual slices.

That being said, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too
short a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you let brisket rest the right way, you can rest
assured that the results will be amazing every time you smoke one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - HOW LONG IS TOO LONG TO LET A BRISKET REST?
As a rule of thumb, for larger cuts like brisket - you will want to rest it for a time period greater than 3 hours. A way to
ensure a properly rested brisket is to even try resting it for 8-12 hours. 

Anything less than 3 hours for a rested brisket will create the chance that you will get a dry piece of meat. You don’t want that.

All you have to do is simply place it in either a Faux Cambro (ice chest) or some kind of warmer oven. This will ensure proper
insulation, and will let the internal temperature of the brisket to come down steadily. 

Since brisket is just a giant piece of meat, you want to rest it just long enough (12 hours maximum) but not too long! Anything
past 12 hours - and you should be questioning if you started the cook too long. 

In other words, 12 hours for resting a brisket is more than sufficient to render all the moisture inside.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LET BRISKET REST TOO LONG?
If you let a brisket rest too long, it will become too cold to eat and you will have to reheat it. 

A good rule of thumb to follow for gauging the internal temperature of a brisket is to never let it go below 150 degree before
serving. That is why if the brisket is rested for longer than the threshold of 12 hours - you will most likely experience a
brisket with a very low internal temperature.

Aside from having to potentially reheat a brisket that was rested for too long, there isn’t really any threat to the moisture or
tenderness present within. It may actually be good to just rest it for as long as you possibly can, since resting for large
amounts of time can certainly help the moisture content steady out. Steadying out moisture just means the moisture inside the
brisket isn’t way too hot, so when you slice it - it won’t immediately just vaporize and cause your meat to dry out instantly.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - CAN YOU REST A BRISKET FOR 6 HOURS?
Yes, resting a brisket for 6 hours is the preferred method from many experienced Pit-Masters. Anything less than resting a brisket
for 6 hours, and you run the chance of having it dry out. That would be terrible!

Actually, if you really want to protect yourself - try resting your brisket for almost 12 hours in the preferred methods of
resting (Faux Cambro/Oven) and you can potentially get an even more moist and tender brisket.

In short, don’t worry much about letting your brisket rest for a period of 6 hours. Especially since that is my preferred time
frame for resting all of my freshly smoked brisket.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - IS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY?
Smoked brisket can be a fantastic meal even though you cooked it the prior day. In fact, you will often find that the entire
brisket cooking process takes over a day anyways. 

Barbecue is one of the types of food where it can be very resilient. This means that not only does it take a lot of beating during
the actual cooking process, but a cut like brisket can taste amazing even though it is over 12-24 hours after the cooking process
has come to a halt.

If you want to make sure the brisket comes out great the next day - just make sure to let it come down in internal temperature
properly. This will preserve all of your moisture and basically make the meat taste great.

Check out this article where I dive a little deeper into how long to let a brisket rest:

HOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST | BBQ DROPOUT PRO TIPS Wondering how long to let a brisket rest? This post will cover that topic in
quite some detail. For the most part, it is recommended to let a brisket rest at least 6-12 hours. That can be quite a lot of
time, but if you want a great, moist, and tender brisket that retains all of its’ moisture - that… BBQ Dropout
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - IS BRISKET BETTER THE NEXT DAY?
We’ve already covered whether a brisket can be good the next day. Now - can it be even better than what it would have been freshly
sliced? 

Potentially!

If you’re considering eating the brisket the next day - like mentioned above - often times you will find that the cooking process
already takes over 24 hours anyways. However, if you’re just considering letting it come all the way down in internal
temperatures, refrigerating it, reheating, then serving - you can still get some amazing results than you would have otherwise. 

To make brisket better the next day - make sure you slowly let it come down in temperature before refrigerating. Once in the
fridge and you are ready to start eating the next day, make sure to slowly start rising the internal temperature to roughly 15o
degrees. This will ensure a great, warm, and moist brisket without losing much of it’s flavor. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG - WHAT TEMPERATURE DO YOU SLICE BRISKET AT?
Slicing the brisket is another very important topic. Regarding what temperature you slice one - Do not slice until the brisket
hits about 150 degrees in internal temperature. that will help to ensure that you don’t lose any moisture, and the brisket will
respond accordingly.

When you want to slice a brisket, just ensure that you take the appropriate measure to keep the internal temperature within that
range. If it goes below 150 degrees in internal temperature, you might have too cold of a brisket. If you try to cut the brisket
above that amount, then you may start to lose all of the moisture that you’ve worked so hard to preserve!]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/can-brisket-rest-too-long/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/can-brisket-rest-too-long/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 17:24:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat.

HOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - CAN I LET BRISKET REST OVERNIGHT?
Yes, you can let a brisket rest overnight. Pit-Masters do it quite frequently. 

If you’re wondering generally speaking how long to rest a brisket - the answer is usually it depends. That’s why I try to use the
ball park estimate of 12 hours. Obviously, there are a lot more factors that go into determining whether you can let a brisket
rest over night such as your method of wrapping and storage location.

The methods of storing a brisket overnight are usually one of two things:

1. Placing the brisket inside an ice chest (Faux Cambro)

2. Placing the Brisket inside of the oven/warmer

These two methods of storing a brisket overnight will help to sufficiently not only keep the brisket temps stable, but will allow
a steady decrease in temperature over a longer period of time. 

When considering holding the brisket overnight - just be sure to finish the cook at a decent time, and factor in a rough estimate
of about 8-12 of rest time in one of those two placement methods. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG?
Don’t worry about resting a brisket too long, especially if you put in the effort of storing it properly. Resting a brisket in the
proper location is critical. Like mentioned above, storing a brisket in either an ice chest cooler or a warming oven can allow you
to hold a brisket for substantially longer periods of time than you otherwise could.

That being said, you CAN rest a brisket too long if you don’t follow the above advice. Any piece of meat, no matter how raging hot
it currently is - will go cold at some point. You don’t want that.

The reason you want to be placing your brisket in a storage area that provides insulation is to allow all of the juices and the
meat itself to come to a reasonable temperature. You don’t want rapid spikes in heat in either direction. Placing it in a
controlled environment will also allow you to make this a repeatable process thus allowing you to create some consistently great
barbecue!

Letting a brisket rest for long periods of time is completely fine, and often practiced by many experienced Pit-Masters. Ever
notice when you head to a really good barbecue restaurant and they’ll pull one of their juicy briskets out of a warmer? Those
briskets have been in there for quite a long time.

Again, generally speaking - you will want to rest a brisket for a substantial amount of time. This equates to roughly 8-12 hours.
Anything past 12 hours is probably over kill - and if you need to let it rest any longer than that, you should start to ask
yourself if you prepared the brisket too early before serving. 

At the end of the day - you can rest assured that a brisket can tolerate not only a ton of heat and smoke during the cook, but
afterwards - can certainly tolerate extended periods of time where it is simply resting.

On the opposite end of the spectrum - it isn’t really suggested to let a brisket rest any shorter than 8-12 hours. That’s simply
because the brisket - depending on the size - has been on the smoker for just about that time or even longer, which suggests that
it is still blazing hot to come back down all the way to the right internal temp to begin slicing.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - IS SMOKED BRISKET GOOD THE NEXT DAY?
Yes, brisket can be very good the next day. With everything though, it can depend, and you will want to take the appropriate steps
to ensure the end product is amazing.

A preferred method of experienced Pit-Masters to ensure a brisket can produce amazing results the next day - is to let it rest
properly. That means storing it in the ice chest or oven for a steady amount of internal temperature decrease. 

Often times, you will find that no matter how you prepare your brisket - you have no choice but to serve the next day anyways.
That’s just because of the length of cooking and resting time. If you add up roughly 12 hours for smoking and 8-12 hours of
resting time - that’s just at around 24 hours total. 

If you aren’t storing the brisket inside a refrigerator - meaning the internal temperature has never come down to sub 100 degree
levels - you can certainly serve a great piece of barbecue the next day.

long can a brisket rest after smoking? How do you store smoked brisket overnight? BBQ Dropout
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - CAN BRISKET REST IN THE FRIDGE?
You absolutely can rest a brisket in the fridge. The reason you would do this is because you have finished smoking the brisket,
and don’t necessarily need to slice into it anytime soon. This would also imply that you don’t mind having to reheat the brisket
once you are ready to start serving.

If you decide to serve the brisket and do not wish to reheat it, then it is not recommended to let it rest in the fridge. The
internal temperature of the brisket will get too low too quick thus requiring you to heat it back up again to an appropriately
serve-able internal temperature.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - HOW LONG SHOULD BRISKET SIT BEFORE REFRIGERATING?
It does not matter how long you let a brisket sit before refrigerating. The only risk in that equation would be that the raging
hot brisket could potentially cause the ambient temperature in the fridge to increase - which would spoil all the other contents
inside. 

For a general rule of thumb - Rest a brisket in an ice chest (Faux Cambro) or some kind of warming oven for about 8-12 hours -
then place the brisket inside of the refrigerator. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - IS IT BETTER TO CUT BRISKET HOT OR COLD?
This can be a tricky one. 

Generally speaking, you want to consider how easy you want it to be to actually slice a brisket. If you were to slice the brisket
while it is relatively warm - the knife should cut through it like butter. On the other-hand - if you were to attempt to slice the
brisket while it is cold and perhaps frozen, it would be very difficult to do so. 

Therefore, it is recommended to slice a brisket while it is warm/hot and NOT when it is cold.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW LONG TO LET BRISKET REST - HOW DO YOU KEEP BRISKET MOIST AFTER CUTTING?
Keeping brisket moist after cutting is a skill that not many can master. 

One of the first things you will need to make sure you do is let the brisket a long enough time. This will ensure that the
moisture within the meat itself isn’t vaporized when you start to slice into it. 

The second thing you need to do while you slice the brisket - is to make sure you don’t separate the slices apart from each other.
This helps to ensure that more of the moisture is retained within the meat. If you don’t, you’ll quickly notice that the meat will
start to dry out. 

Brisket is a very finicky piece of meat!]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/how-long-to-let-brisket-rest/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/how-long-to-let-brisket-rest/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 17:17:41 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wondering how long to let a brisket rest? This post will cover that topic in quite some detail. For the most part, it is recommended to let a brisket rest at least 6-12 hours. That can be quite a lot of time, but if you want a great, moist, and tender brisket that retains all of its’ moisture - that is what you should do.

Pit-Masters do it quite frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering generally speaking how long to rest a brisket - the answer is usually it depends. That’s why I try to use the ball park estimate of 12 hours. Obviously, there are a lot more factors that go into determining whether you can let a brisket rest over night such as your method of wrapping and storage location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The methods of storing a brisket overnight are usually one of two things:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.  Placing the brisket inside an ice chest (Faux Cambro)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.  Placing the Brisket inside of the oven/warmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two methods of storing a brisket overnight will help to sufficiently not only keep the brisket temps stable, but will allow a steady decrease in temperature over a longer period of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering holding the brisket overnight - just be sure to finish the cook at a decent time, and factor in a rough estimate of about 8-12 of rest time in one of those two placement methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How long to let Brisket Rest - Can brisket rest too long?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about resting a brisket too long, especially if you put in the effort of storing it properly. Resting a brisket in the proper location is critical. Like mentioned above, storing a brisket in either an ice chest cooler or a warming oven can allow you to hold a brisket for substantially longer periods of time than you otherwise could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, you CAN rest a brisket too long if you don’t follow the above advice. Any piece of meat, no matter how raging hot it currently is - will go cold at some point. You don’t want that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason you want to be placing your brisket in a storage area that provides insulation is to allow all of the juices and the meat itself to come to a reasonable temperature. You don’t want rapid spikes in heat in either direction. Placing it in a controlled environment will also allow you to make this a repeatable process thus allowing you to create some consistently great barbecue!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out this article where I dive a litter deeper into this subject:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-card-container&quot; href=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/can-brisket-rest-too-long/&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;bookmark-title&quot;&gt;Can brisket rest too long?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;bookmark-description&quot;&gt;How long is too long to let a brisket rest?

In order to figure out when to pull a brisket off the smoker, there are a variety of questions that people tend to ask. They are
noted down below, but for reference - you essentially want to pull your brisket off the cooker right at around 200 degrees
internal. That is the objective measure by which you can can know when your brisket is done cooking. The second most important
factor in this equation is how long you let it rest. I’ve gone through many briskets that have probed properly at 200 degrees
internal, but were sliced way too soon and it ruined the whole thing. With that being said, I like to rest my briskets as long as
I can tolerate it. That means the briskets I smoke are rested for over 12 hours.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHEN TO PULL BRISKET OFF SMOKER?
This is a highly debated topic, but I’ll give you a simple answer:

> Pull the Brisket off at 200 degrees fahrenheit.


That is the first thing you should be considering when you pull a brisket off the smoker. That’s really all it takes to know when
to pull a brisket off the smoker. 

Of course, you can get into meat thermometer placement, whether or not you should wrap the brisket, how to pull the brisket off
the smoker, etc. But from a simplicity sake, just stick your thermometer in one of the more thicker parts of the meat and pull it
at 200 degrees. DONE.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN I PULL BRISKET AT 190?
Absolutely not! 

Every meat is different, sure. However, in general - every brisket I have gone to the trouble of smoking and pulling off before it
ever reaches 200 degrees internal simply came out way too tough and undercooked.

Pulling brisket at 190 degrees internal is one of the worst mistakes you can make when smoking a brisket. I remember cooking this
amazing looking brisket several years ago when I was first starting my barbecue career. It looked like it was cooked all the way
through, but my patience was wearing thin and I just decided to try and pull the brisket at around 190 degrees. The brisket came
out awful and way too tough to even eat.

Moral of the story - just make sure to pull your brisket at 200 degrees internal as a rough estimate as to when it should be ready
and you will for the most part be good to go.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOES BRISKET GET MORE TENDER THE LONGER YOU COOK IT?
Actually, yes it does!

Obviously you don’t want to overcook a brisket - that can certainly happen - but the most important quality of smoking a brisket
is to cook it all the way through. That basically means to cook it just at around 200 degrees internal like mentioned above, and
to take a toothpick - or some other sharp elongated device - and to start probing around the piece of meat. This will check to
test whether or not your brisket is probe tender.

Probing the meat all around as you cook it longer will ensure that all of the collagen has rendered down. This is why you always
hear people go off and on about how the brisket should ‘probe like a stick of butter’.

There’s a whole science behind this process.

The longer the brisket has to cook all of the heavily compacted collagen inside, the better. When you think about it, a brisket is
just a GIANT muscle. This muscle has all kinds of connective tissue that is VERY tough to cut through, let alone to try and eat!

That’s why it becomes somewhat counter-intuitive to cook a brisket, or really any traditional piece of barbecue for that matter,
all the way past roughly 200 degrees internal.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DO YOU LET BRISKET REST IN FOIL?
You certainly could! 

Personally, I find it best to rest a smoked brisket that’s hot off the smoker in either an ice cooler or the oven. These are
better ways to ensure that no heat will escape quickly. Furthermore, if you were to just transfer your foil wrapped brisket onto
another surface, you run the risk of the internal temp increasing way above what you wanted.

 Basically, letting a brisket rest in foil can serve to preserve the brisket’s internal temperature - but you run the risk of
having it overcook way to quickly then losing all of the heat. Kind of a weird combo.

By placing it in an ice cooler or an oven, you get the best of both worlds. The temperature usually does not increase - meaning no
risk of over cooking it - and the brisket will gradually come down in temps. It won’t come down way to quickly.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN I PULL A BRISKET AT 200?
This is what we’ve all been waiting for… YES!

If you haven’t noticed, i’ve been mentioning that you definitely will want to smoke your brisket all the way to 200 degrees
internal before pulling it.

Not only do you want to pull a brisket at 200, but you also are going to want to start to begin resting the thing. That’s one of
the single most important qualities of a smoked brisket. 

> LET YOUR BRISKET REST AFTER YOU PULL IT!


I have gone through many many many briskets where I frankly just cut into them WAY too soon and the end product was just very
lackluster. One day, I smoked and pulled my brisket at 200 degrees internal and decided to let it rest for over 12 hours in an ice
cooler. When it was finally sliced, the brisket was one of the most juicy briskets I had ever smoked. 

Ever since then, that has lead me - the BBQ DROPOUT - to understand just how important it really is to properly pull and rest a
freshly smoked brisket.]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/when-to-pull-brisket-off-smoker/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/when-to-pull-brisket-off-smoker/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 19:42:14 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In order to figure out when to pull a brisket off the smoker, there are a variety of questions that people tend to ask.

It won’t come down way to quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I pull a brisket at 200?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what we’ve all been waiting for… YES!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t noticed, i’ve been mentioning that you definitely will want to smoke your brisket all the way to 200 degrees internal before pulling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do you want to pull a brisket at 200, but you also are going to want to start to begin resting the thing. That’s one of the single most important qualities of a smoked brisket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;LET YOUR BRISKET REST AFTER YOU PULL IT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have gone through many many many briskets where I frankly just cut into them WAY too soon and the end product was just very lackluster. One day, I smoked and pulled my brisket at 200 degrees internal and decided to let it rest for over 12 hours in an ice cooler. When it was finally sliced, the brisket was one of the most juicy briskets I had ever smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, that has lead me - the BBQ DROPOUT - to understand just how important it really is to properly pull and rest a freshly smoked brisket.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best wood for smoking pork?]]></title><description><![CDATA[What is the Best wood for smoking pork? OAK WOOD!]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/best-wood-for-smoking-pork/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/best-wood-for-smoking-pork/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 18:11:31 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve always wondered what the best wood for smoking pork is, keep reading!&lt;/strong&gt; Specifically, the best wood for smoking  pork is Oak wood. The reason Oak wood is the best word for smoking  pork is because it has a light and sweet aroma and taste that gets imparted onto the meat perfectly. Most other types of wood do not do this. Types of wood like Mesquite are way too strong. Fruit tree such as Apple, or cherry, are on the opposite end of the spectrum and are simply not strong enough to impart any kind of meaningful flavor to the meat itself. Now, all of that being said you can certainly use other types of wood for smoking pork that aren’t oak wood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Here are the best types of wood for smoking pork:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oak&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pecan&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hickory&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mesquite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Oak Wood for Smoking Pork&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oakwood is part of the Quintessential Texas Style method for smoking pork. It has excellent flavor profiles, ranging from hard and smoky to sweet and flavorful. Most people in Texas especially, will only use Oakwood to smoke all of their meat. It’s not only for smoking pork. This means that you are commonly find people using any type of OakWord to smoke any type of meat in their smoker. Another great choice while using Oakwood for smoking meat would have to be a brisket and ribs of all kinds. Speaking of pork, it usually has a natural sweet taste to it, so by using pork and Oak wood together makes it a perfect duo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, there are even different types of Oak wood that you can use to smoke pork. This includes Post Oak, live Oak, red oak, and white oak. All of which have the same over arching sweet flavor profile mixed in with a hearty smoke flavor. The most prominent type of Oak wood to be smoking pork with however, is Postoak. That is what I mean by the quintessential Texas style Way of smoking pork. Not only does Oak wood in general pair well with pork for smoking, it also serves as a great base for applying seasoning to the meat. Regarding seasoning and putting it on your smoked pork, Oakwood is most beneficially paired with kosher salt and black pepper. Regarding this specific types of cuts of pork that is greatly paired with Oak Wood, pulled pork, pork ribs, pork shoulder, and even ham all can have amazing flavor. Not only is Oak wood great at imparting differing degrees of flavor into your pork, the texture is quite versatile as well. Most woods you have to pick based on their flavor and texture because some of them burn quicker than others. Oak of all kinds has the unique property of being able to be burned with either hot and fast or low and slow types of cooks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best wood for Smoking Pulled pork&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having pulled pork shoulder paired with Oakwood specifically is an amazing combo. The pork shoulder has a high fat content which is somewhat salty and rich but simply melts in your mouth when combined with the sweet and savory taste of Oakwood. Pairing any of the above mentioned types of Oakwood like Post Oak or Live Oak to a pork shoulder creates a simply amazing product of barbecue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;default-size-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1620425018017.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Best wood for smoking pork? Post Oak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Pecan Wood for Smoking Pork&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecan wood is an interesting type of wood to be smoking with in the first place. It has a light and nutty note to it, and also can captivate anyone around when you were actually smoking with the wood itself. The reason it tends to get a lot of attention when you are smoking with it is because of its unique scent. Not only does it have an amazing scent filled profile, Pecan wood is great at imparting that flavor on to even the roughest cuts of meat like pork. It can be a great way to combine the nutty flavor into the rich and fatty parts of your cook. The texture of the wood itself is also great for cooking low and slow. It doesn’t really burn that hot or fast - so it makes for an excellent combination when combined with those traditional cuts of pork that need to be cooked very thoroughly such as pork shoulder. Pork shoulder usually requires long cooks just due to the general size of the cuts of meat you will get, and depending on the preference of the pit-master can be a great type of wood to get smoking with pork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smoking Pork on Pecan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, pecan wood can be an excellent way to get a low and slow cooked piece of pork. Since generally speaking it’s a light burning type of wood you are going to predominantly be smoking those larger cuts like a pork shoulder. The smoke flavor will be rather nutty in profile and provide a very mild smoke ring to the meet. Depending on what seasoning you actually are considering and using, it can serve as a gray undertone for the meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And most cooks that I have done with pecan and pork shoulder specifically, the bark has never really been that dark in the outer crust has never really been two overtly burnt or charred which is an excellent quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hickory Wood for Smoking Pork&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hickory is one of the types of word where the flavor skews more towards being smoky. Not only does it have that smokiness flavor to it, but it also has a lot of no and hearty types of flavor to it. Along with pecan wood, hickory is a great and versatile way to smoke any kind of barbecue. Commonly however,People will tend to use it for the tough cuts of meat such as pork and brisket. Between those two types of meats Hickory is best served alongside pork. The reason for that is because brisket should only ever be smoked with Oakwood. That is just the Texas way of doing things sorry y’all! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hickory also it does not tend to burn as hot and fast as some of its other wood counterparts. If you want a low and slow type of cook and are also thinking of smoking a pork shoulder of some kind you should be thinking of hickory or pecan wood for that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smoking Pork on Hickory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a nutty, earthy, but yet slightly Smokey flavor - you’ll want to smoke some pork over a few chunks of Hickory. Hickory can be one of the best types of wood if you’re looking for a lighter version of Oak Wood. Pork shoulder is a great option for hickory. Usually, it doesn’t take a whole lot of effort to impart a lot of wood flavor onto pork shoulder. Brisket on the other hand, is a much tougher piece of meat to get the flavor just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite brisket being a relatively difficult piece of barbecue to nail with just about every type of wood, pork shoulder can certainly obtain flavor from all of the types I mention in this article. At this point it’s really a matter of preference as to which type of wood is best for smoking pork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Smoking Pork shoulder on Hickory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you want to smoke a pork shoulder over Hickory? Excellent choice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you choose to use a pork shoulder while cooking with hickory, just know that overall, pork is a great piece of meat to impart smoke flavor onto. It can take on plenty of smoke flavor while also taking on the individual characteristics of each respective type of wood. For hickory - you will be able to combine the natural fatty profile of the pork shoulder along with the earthy, nutty, and general smoke flavor into the meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a look below - you should see a slight smoke ring on the tips of the pork shoulder:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;default-size-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1620424812083.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Best wood for smoking pork? - Pork over Hickory&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Mesquite Wood for Smoking Pork&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesquite is one of the strongest types of wood you could be using for pork. Not only that, it is generally considered the number one guaranteed way to impart a very strong smoke flavor onto ANY type of barbecue. It’s primarily one of the types of wood actually used for tougher cuts such as brisket - but definitely has applications for lesser tough cuts such as pork shoulder. It’s not really recommended to use it on other general types of meat like pork loin, pork chops, and pork ribs - UNLESS you want a REALLY Smokey flavor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The qualities preset throughout a mesquite smoked piece of pork will present you with a very Smokey filled flavor. There aren’t a whole lot of mineral or earthy components to the taste, nor are there any type of nutty tones. This wood is strictly if you want the general taste of something REALLY smokey. And I mean REALLY SMOKEY. That’s honestly what mesquite wood is for. It’s primarily for the most thickets cuts of meat, specifically barbecue oriented cuts of meat. That makes it a great way to get some awesome smoke flavor onto your pork shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Buying Brisket at Costco? Here’s what you need to know]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ever shop at Costco and think how amazing it is? The wholesale pricing scheme and general availability of whatever you could ever
want out of a large grocery store makes it the perfect place to get any type of food in bulk. You can buy more for less than you
could in a traditional grocery store, and that is why I wanted to cover Buying brisket at Costco:

How much is Prime Brisket per pound?



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW MUCH IS BRISKET AT COSTCO?
One of the neat things about brisket is that it is actually fairly cheap compared to more of the ‘desired’ cuts of meat such as
ribeye. Usually, Brisket at Costco averages anywhere from $1.99/lb for a really low grade all the way up to $6.99/lb for cuts like
Waygu. 

Even at the upper end of the spectrum, that is miles apart from what you could see with other cuts of meat in the same grade. 

COSTCO BRISKET PRICE (2021):
So, getting into the nitty gritty…

Here’s the beef brisket price per pound at Costco:

Brisket GradePrice Per PoundSelect$1.99/lbChoice$2.99/lbPrime$4.99/lb
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOES COSTCO SELL BEEF BRISKET?
They absolutely do! 

One of the best things about buying Brisket at Costco is that you can buy a ton in bulk, for a discounted rate. That means that
you can buy the more ‘expensive’ cuts or grades of brisket - for cheap.

The variety of briskets that Costco sells are diverse. 

Here’s the different types of brisket at Costco:

 * Whole Packer Style Briskets
 * Brisket Flat
 * Brisket Point

As you can tell - Costco has a fairly diverse selection on the type of brisket you can buy. This ranges from a packer style
brisket to just select parts of a particular brisket - the flat or the point.

This is common among many grocery stores. Their goals is to give the customer the most amount of selection desired. 

Typically, I like to just go straight for the whole packer style briskets. They are cheaper on a per pound basis, and you get to
cook and modify the brisket as you like.

However, some people just really like prepackaged parts of the brisket and will opt for either just a flat (leaner) or point
(fattier) part of the brisket.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS BRISKET CALLED AT COSTCO?
Costco labels their briskets as:

 * USDA Prime Commodity Beef Brisket
 * USDA Choice Commodity Brisket
 * USDA Select Commodity Brisket

These are generally packer style briskets, meaning they are whole briskets that have not been sliced or cut into different pieces.
Typically when this is done, the butcher will separate the point from the flat and sell each of those pieces individually for a
higher price per pound.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW MUCH DOES COSTCO BRISKET COST?
A BRISKET AT COSTCO CAN SELL FOR ANYWHERE FROM $40-$70 FOR A WHOLE PACKER STYLE BRISKET.
It depends on the type of brisket you are buying and the grade of the brisket you are buying at Costco. What this means is that
there are a wide variety of briskets that Costco likes to package up and sell. 

Let’s look into this some more:

Types of Brisket at Costco:

 * Whole Packer Style Brisket
 * Flat Separated Brisket
 * Point Separated Brsiket

Price per pound of Brisket at Costco:

 * Prime Grade: $4.99/lb
 * Choice Grade: $2.99/lb
 * Select Grade: $1.99/lb

Putting it Together:

To get the best bang for your buck when buying brisket at Costco - I recommend you to buy a whole packer style brisket. You are
just buying all of the meat, and you are not being up-charged due to having a specialty cut of brisket. 

A recent example of a brisket I saw at Costco - a whole packer brisket weighed in at around 12 lbs, costing roughly $4.99lb. This
equates to a total price of $63.82. 

If you were to only take a flat cut of the brisket - weighing in at around 5lbs and costing almost $8.99lb (since it’s a specialty
cut it’s more expensive on a per pound basis) - that would be roughy $45. So not only are you paying more for a smaller cut of
brisket - you’re paying more for a lesser grade of brisket as well.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS THE BEST BRISKET TO BUY?
THE BEST BRISKET TO BUY IS ONE THAT FITS INTO YOUR BUDGET. IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUDGET ROUGHLY $70 FOR A BRISKET -
DEFINITELY GO WITH A WHOLE PRIME PACKER BRISKET. OTHERWISE - CONSIDER EITHER GOING FOR A LESSER GRADE WHOLE PACKER BRISKET OR
PERHAPS A PRIME GRADE SPECIALTY CUT BRISKET.
When buying a brisket at Costco - you will want to select one one the following order:

 1. Prime Whole Packer Brisket (Budget $70)
 2. Consider going for a lesser grade whole packer (Less than $70)
 3. Choose a Prime grade special cut of brisket

The reason you always go with a whole packer brisket first is simply because it preserves the integrity of the meat, and allows
you to obtain even more meat than you would for the same price of a cut of specialty brisket. 

In other words, buying a whole packer brisket is a lot more cost efficient than buying any kind of specially cut brisket.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW MUCH IS PRIME BRISKET PER POUND?
COSTCO PRIME BRISKET PER POUND IS ROUGHLY $4.99/LB.
Costco has a great selection of all types of meat, especially brisket. When looking in the meat counter bin - glance over at how
much a prime brisket costs. As notated above, a single whole prime packer brisket can cost as much/little as $4.99/lb.

When comparing this to other slices of meat that are of the same grade, quality or marbling, this can be an excellent deal. Not
only that, you get up to 20lbs of brisket at a time. That’s awesome.

WHAT YOUR BUDGET AND BRISKET GRADE IS AND HOW IT PLAYS INTO THE BRISKET PRICE
Buying a brisket is an important process. It already costs a significant amount of your time just cooking the thing, so it makes
sense to buy the right one. 

How do you determine the right brisket to buy at the right price? 

Check your budget and analyze how much you are willing to expend. This should determine what grade you should be buying. What this
means is, if you don’t have a TON of money to be spending on a finicky piece of meat like brisket, it’s probably not a good idea
to be buying an expensive version of brisket. 

Don’t worry though, you can still smoke an amazing brisket without even having to buy an expensive grade such as prime or Waygu .
If you’re interested in learning more about USDA Prime brisket specifically, please reference this article where BBQ Dropout
provides in-depth insight:

WHAT IS USDA PRIME BRISKET? What is USDA Prime Brisket? BBQ DropoutWhat you’ll want to look for in cases where you aren’t able to
expend anymore than $30 for a single brisket packer - you will want to look for an either select or choice grade brisket. If
you’re concerned about the price per pound for each grade of brisket - I’ll be covering that in just one moment.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHERE YOU ARE BUYING A PRIME BRISKET AND HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS CAN PLAY HEAVILY INTO THE PRICE
There’s two factors at play here:

 1. Where you are buying the prime brisket from
 2. How much the prime brisket weighs

WHERE YOU ARE BUYING THE PRIME BRISKET FROM IS A PRETTY INTERESTING TOPIC:
 If you’re in the great state of Texas, you’re in luck! The wonderful grocery store H-E-B provides excellent pricing, especially
for brisket. We also have places like Costco, where you can certainly buy just as price effective briskets - but H-E-B is
unparalleled. 

If you’re in other parts of the United States, just go with Costco. It’s still a great place to source amazing quality barbecue.
They have all the different grades. Now, the only thing I’m uncertain of is - do they have all of the different grades PLUS
different variations of each grade of brisket?

What I mean by that is, you have the top three grades of brisket - select, choice, prime. At H-E-B, you have all of that plus you
can easily pick up just the brisket flat, the brisket point, burnt ends, and trimmed briskets - all separately as their own piece.
Quite amazing!

Alright, so whether you are buying a prime grade brisket at either H-E-B, Costco, or any other grocery store nearest to you:

HOW MUCH DOES IT WEIGH?
That’s a great question. 

BBQ Dropout covered this in his latest post regarding what a USDA Prime Brisket is - however you want to get a piece of meat that
is evenly distributed throughout. This means that both the flat and point are relatively consistent in their thickness. This
prevents any possible over cooking. Believe me, I’ve done plenty of briskets where both Ends of the brisket were either severely
under cooked or severely overcooked or both. 

Get insight into how long to rest a brisket here:

CAN BRISKET REST TOO LONG? | BBQ DROPOUT’S TAKE Brisket can absolutely rest too long, just like any other type of meat. That being
said, you don’t want to rest a brisket for too short a time - either. Brisket can be a tricky piece of meat to handle, but if you
let brisket rest the right way, you can rest assured that the results will be amazing e… BBQ DropoutThis is just something that
you want to try and avoid because if you spend a lot of money on a certain brisket and you don’t precisely measure the sickness of
the point in the flat part of the brisket, then you open the possibility to really messing up your overall cook. 

No, you don’t actually have to precisely measure the thickness and weight of the brisket, but it just helps to get and eyeballs
glance of the relative thickness of each part of the brisket. What this means basically, is that you want to sickness of the flat
and the point of the brisket to be relatively uniform. This will not only make sure that your cooks will come out great, but you
can rest assured that the weight distribution among all parts of the brisket are even.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BONUS:
Depending on the grocery store do you happen to frequent, you will find that there are multiple types of brisket, with multiple
different grades of brisket, and most of all different cuts of brisket. Generally speaking a brisket that is in entire packer
brisket can range anywhere from 10 to 20 pounds. I personally have never found a brisket more than 20 pounds, but I do know that
they exist out in the wild.

 Usually, a good grocery store will actually package up a flat part of the brisket which is just the leaner, front part of the
brisket where it is harder to get tender. These can range anywhere from 3 to 5 pounds in weight. For the point sections of a
brisket that is packaged up as it’s on separate entity, you will generally find that they weigh about 3 pounds as well.

 Just be aware that these ranges can vary. 

I’m just trying to convey the average weight that I have personally seen.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOW, YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF HOW DOES ALL OF THIS PLAN TO THE PRICE OF THE ACTUAL BRISKET?
That is a really good question. When you factor in about $2.99 per pound in a prime brisket, this can add up quite a bit of
money.. Which is why you want to Pay close attention to where you get your brisket from, and how much each brisket that you were
buying Weights.

Now taking all of this into consideration, I definitely try to incorporate all of those above points. I try to go to the store
whether that be Costco or H-E-B that I believe will give me the best bang for my buck. I want to get the best possible price for
the best possible brisket so I can have an amazing output.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
 To sum everything up, what I really want to stress is perhaps even take a look at the purpose of actually smoking a brisket. Do
this, and see what type of event we may be smoking for.

 Is it just for yourself?

 Or is it for a large event? 

These factors could also play a part in the price of the brisket in which type of brisket you buy as well as the creative process.
It’s honestly pretty fun and the outcome is simply amazing. 

 I generally try to keep my budget around $30-$50 in price for a single brisket regardless of whatever choice grade or prime grade
brisket it happens to be. Then, I will try to shop at either Costco or H-E-B. I believe they will give me the best price per pound
of brisket, for the best grade.]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/prime-brisket-price/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/prime-brisket-price/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 21:10:47 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying Prime Brisket is an important decision - one that comes with a price tag associated with it.

This should determine what grade you should be buying. What this means is, if you don’t have a TON of money to be spending on a finicky piece of meat like brisket, it’s probably not a good idea to be buying an expensive version of brisket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry though, you can still smoke an amazing brisket without even having to buy an expensive grade such as prime or Waygu .

I’m glad you asked! Get ready. We’re going to be covering the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is USDA Prime Brisket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is prime brisket worth the money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is prime brisket cheaper than choice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you pick a beef brisket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best brisket to buy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime Brisket Price?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is USDA Prime Brisket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a very good question! Only the best piece of meat in the WORLD. This is actually a  highly sought after topic, as you can see from the list above. Frankly, it doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of all things Brisket. Let alone Prime Brisket. There’s just so much that goes into picking the right sized cut of meat, how to cook it, equipment involved, the list goes on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in case you were wondering … a USDA Prime Brisket is one of the best grades you can possibly buy from a grocery store. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is that? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple. The fat contents. Ever heard of marbling? That just means there is a lot of interconnected fat between the muscle fibers in the meat. Basically, the cow was really fat and juicy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cool. So, what is USDA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDA in this context stands for the United States Department of Agriculture. It is an official attestation to you, as the customer, that any cut of meat you are about to buy is effectively certified by a governing agency.  Think of it as the government’s seal-of-approval. Not that you always need government approval, but it’s just a way of implementing relatively strict standards for meat processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that respect, a USDA Prime Brisket is truly one of the best tasting, tender, and forgiving pieces of brisket. Granted, Brisket is generally coveted as one of the more difficult pieces of barbecue to get right. That being said, getting a Prime Brisket will generally speaking will be a lot easier to cook properly rather than a lesser grade such as Choice and Select. This is due to the fat contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I please see a picture of a Prime Brisket?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You sure can! Here you go:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;default-size-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1619905544339.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;USDA Prime Grade Brisket&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Prime Brisket worth the money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, i’ve often wondered that very question myself. Short answer is yes. Long answer is … it depends. When I first started barbecuing, I was a broke college kid working a job at HEB (local grocery store here in Texas). Not having a ton of money - I started at the absolute bottom of the barrel. My brisket career began with a Select Grade cut of brisket. The very first cook with it was miserable too. It took over 24 hours and the thing just came out SO dry. That wasn’t the last time I ever smoked a Select Grade brisket, but I definitely try to only go for Prime now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;yeah but, why is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you why. Prime Grade brisket is generally a fattier piece of meat. Having a fat piece of barbecue will only make things taste better and is generally very forgiving.  Brisket is already a finicky enough cut as it is, and by getting one with plenty of marbling - you will effectively be creating some amazing barbecue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, they can be fairly pricey. The averaged size brisket you will see here in the great state of TEXAS is on average between 10lbs-20lbs. That is a LOT of meat! Even though the price is relatively low compared to something like a Ribeye, due to the large quantity - you will be paying roughly $40-$50 per brisket in that pound range. Don’t worry though, it’s literally an almost 20lb piece of meat. Think about how long that will last you. No joke - a brisket can last you the entire week. Plus it tastes AMAZING!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Prime Brisket cheaper than choice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that really the case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it may seem like it is! However, you have to realize what you are comparing. Simply saying prime is cheaper than choice opens the door for more questions. You also have to check if you are really comparing the exact same CUT of brisket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by CUT of brisket?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I mean is … Brisket is generally sold in a variety of formats, other than just the grade of fat contents. I told you these are loaded questions!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a better understanding of the different cuts of brisket please see the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brisket Packer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brisket Flat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brisket Point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brisket Burnt Ends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are generally the most common forms of brisket that you will either hear about or come across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brisket Packer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Brisket Packer is the whole brisket. This means the flat, point, and burnt end portions are all included. This is the most famous cut of brisket and will be primarily what you will see talked and posted about in this blog. The brisket is actually a combination of two muscles - the point and flat. The point is the meatier and fattier portion while the flat is the leaner and lesser part of the overall brisket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brisket Flat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brisket flat is, like I said, the leaner portion of the brisket. It’s also the most prone to going dry, so watch out for that! It really takes a true pit-master to not only make sure it comes out alright, but to ensure all areas of the brisket are well taken care of. You will find brisket flats all around the grocery store much like you would a packer style brisket. The difference is just - what part you want the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brisket Point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brisket point is honestly my favorite part of the meat. That’s simply due to the amount of flavor, fat, and tenderness that comes with it. The Point of a brisket, notably a USDA Prime Brisket, will provide you with the upmost flavor. It’s almost too overwhelming and rich, but will certainly be one of the most amazing pieces of meat you will EVER experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brisket Burnt Ends&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisket burnt ends are another great delicacy. They are essentially the brisket point - cubed up into smaller pieces called ‘ends’ and are thrown back onto the smoker (or whatever cooking device you are using) for maximum fat caramelization. Yes, they are quite amazing. Usually you have to make them yourself since most grocery stores don’t cater to that specific palate. That being said, they are definitely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That should all clear things up regarding the different CUTS of brisket. Now, let’s revisit the overarching question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is prime brisket cheaper than choice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer would depend on whether or not you are actually comparing the same cut of brisket. Meaning, are you comparing two brisket packers together? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or are you comparing a USDA Prime Grade Packer Brisket which a Choice Grade Flat? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the divided up portions of the brisket will be more expensive on a per pound basis regardless of the Grade you select. This means that  the Packer style briskets will be cheaper overall on a per pound basis than a separated flat, point, or burnt ends style brisket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you pick a Beef Brisket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be harder than it seems … but don’t worry - i’ll tell you how! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just make sure that you head on over to your local grocery store - in my case, that is H-E-B. Walk over to the meat market display and see what’s available. For the purpose of this post, we’ll be discussing how to select a USDA Prime Brisket. Take a look at what you have at your disposal - how many briskets are there in the case? Sometimes here in Texas most of the good quality briskets are all picked over!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that what I would commonly have to do, especially around any important holiday - is to get there early. YUP that is a pro tip. Let me reiterate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;notice px-4 py-2 rounded bg-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the best selection of USDA Prime Brisket - Get to the store early!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most meat markets will actually get shipments everyday - early in the morning. Getting to the store right as they open  will simply ensure that you have the best possible selection. For other cuts of meat such as Picanha, the same method applies. If you don’t know what Picanha is or how to smoke/cook one, checkout my previous blog posts where I shed some light on that here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-card-container&quot; href=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/what-are-the-different-picanha-cuts/&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;bookmark-title&quot;&gt;What are the different Picanha Cuts?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;bookmark-description&quot;&gt;What are the different Picanha Cuts? There are three main Picanha Cuts.

This will ensure that

grate. Once your Smoker is up to …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/icons/icon-512x512.png?v=040e94e31df278aecae934ec416b79ee&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bookmark-author&quot;&gt;BBQ Dropout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;min-width:33.3%&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-thumbnail flex-grow&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; src=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/static/70799c45ef32fe7e46f56720cb10aab2/featurePost_1619652680738.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in the process,  you have gotten to the store and ensured you have maximized the possibility of you finding the perfect Prime Brisket. That’s GREAT! But not all it takes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll see very quickly that there are a lot of different sized briskets, each with varying degrees of marbling, and packaging. Some look fresh and red - and some look loosely vacuumed sealed. You definitely don’t want one that is loosely sealed. You also don’t want one with an uneven thickness. What I mean by that point is that you should be checking to see if both sides of the meat are in proportion to one another. A Prime Grade Brisket with a huge point but a little tiny flat is probably not one you want to be smoking. Other wise you will way over cook the flat before you ever are able to cook through the point. Mind Blown!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s even another factor that goes into selecting the correct brisket - the bend test!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What in tarnation is the bend test?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a term applied to two different stages in the brisket process - selecting and assessing the finished product. For purposes of this post, I’ll just focus on the first meaning - The bend test. When selecting the most epic Prime Grade Brisket is when you have determined it is of excellent marbling, thickness, and proportion. A combination of all three of these very important selections will let you place the brisket over your hand (you have to be strong since it’s a potentially 20lb piece of meat) and let it bend over both sides of your hand. This will attest to the true fat and protein ratios present within. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the Best Brisket to Buy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best brisket to buy, is generally speaking one that you can afford and that will give you the best end product. It’s really a combination of those two factors. Believe me, I understand how expensive a single cut of brisket can cost. Especially a Prime Grade Brisket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know what? Let me write a separate post specifically around this topic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-card-container&quot; href=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/what-is-the-best-brisket-to-buy/&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;bookmark-title&quot;&gt;What is the Best Brisket to Buy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;bookmark-description&quot;&gt;What is the Best Brisket to Buy? I’ve been wondering that myself! Let’s dig into the following questions: * What is the Best Brisket to Buy? * Is Costco Prime Beef Really Prime Beef? * How much is Prime Brisket per pound? * Why is Brisket so expensive? * Where is the best place to buy brisket…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/icons/icon-512x512.png?v=040e94e31df278aecae934ec416b79ee&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bookmark-author&quot;&gt;BBQ Dropout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;min-width:33.3%&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-thumbnail flex-grow&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; src=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/static/a3c53b6587344eb885079e5ea3dfecca/cover_1619658702735.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a gander at the above post. Essentially what you want to look at your budget. What amount of money are you able to expend for an amazingly marbled Prime Grade Brisket? Once you have determined that important factor - take a look at what grade of brisket you are interested in. Generally, I only buy USDA Prime Grade Brisket. That isn’t because I am a BBQ Snob, it’s because I really enjoy all of the marbling that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prime Brisket Price?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are varying degrees in price ranges for brisket. The difference in prices are generally from the different grades of brisket you can pick up, the difference in weight, and the different stores selling briskets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information into this subject, reference this blog post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prices across the board all vary to a significant degree. This is even more true when considering specifically USDA Prime Grade Brisket. In my situation, a recent look at some briskets at H-E-B (again, my local grocery store) was roughly $3 per lb! This doesn’t seem like a lot, but when multiplying that by the average weight of the meat - 15-20lbs - it can definitely add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s use an example of taking a USDA Prime Grade Brisket that weighs 15lbs and cost about $3 per pound:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
15lbs X $3 per Pound = $45
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may not seem like a lot, but if you are catering for a large crowd - this can certainly add up. That’s why it’s important to consider the three main points laid out previously:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your budget&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grade of Brisket&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where you are sourcing your brisket&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information into this subject, reference this blog post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bookmark-card-container&quot; href=&quot;https://bbqdropout.com/prime-brisket-price/&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bookmark-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;bookmark-title&quot;&gt;Prime Brisket Price? | Three points to make&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;bookmark-description&quot;&gt;Let’s talk about how much a prime brisket is!

To get the best Smoked Picanha you will firstly want to start your smoker well before you start your cook. This will ensure that
the heat is high enough and you won’t have to wait around for the temperature to come up when you place your Smoked Picanha on the
grate. Once your Smoker is up to temp - Go ahead and properly season your Smoked Picanha with Kosher Salt & Black Pepper. If you
do not want to wrap the Picanha during the cook, just leave it as is and place it on the Smoker. Let the Smoker do it’s thing and
when the internal temperature hits around 135-145 feel free to pull it off the smoker. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMOKING PICANHA - GETTING STARTED:
To get the most amazing Smoked Picanha, there are a variety of items to make sure you are equipped with:

 * Picanha Roast with a large FAT CAP
 * Smoker 
 * Oak Wood and Charcoal
 * Thermometer
 * Kosher Salt and Black Pepper


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMOKING PICANHA - PICANHA ROAST WITH A LARGE FAT CAP
> Why is it important to get a Picanha with a large Fat Cap?


I’ll tell you why… 

Having a Fat Cap on the sirloin (official word for Picanha) ensures multiples things. The first of which is that it will ensure
just about every bite you take of the sliced Smoked Picanha will not only TASTE AMAZING but will MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. Basically
you’ll have both taste and texture knocked out of the park!

What can be better than that?

> Alright, so what does a smoked sirloin cap look like exactly?


Behold:

Smoking Picanha on a Smoker - Smoked PicanhaNow, just take a quick look at that amazing looking cut of meat. Notice that EXTRA
LARGE Smoked sirloin cap? Quite impressive! It truly is an amazing piece of meat. A shame not many people know about it!

Here is what the Smoked Picanha will look like BEFORE you even start smoking or seasoning it:

Smoking Picanha on a Smoker - Raw PicanhaNotice the very large Fat cap over that thing? That’s what you want to look for. I know
I’m stressing the fat cap, but it REALLY makes a difference in the end product. It’s basically the most featured part of the meat
- making it SO UNIQUE!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMOKING PICANHA - THE SMOKER
Alright, for this particular cook - I used my Offset Smoker. You honestly could use any smoker, but I was in the mood for doing it
on the offset smoker since you have easy access to the firebox - potentially letting me reverse sear the Picanha once I have fully
smoked it.

If you’re relatively new to using an Offset Smoker - don’t worry. It’s not as hard as some people make it out to be. That being
said, I have an article where I go into detail regarding how to clean one:

HOW TO CLEAN OFFSET SMOKER? TL;DR: Learn how to effectively clean and protect an offset smoker! All you need to do for cleaning an
offset smoker is to grab a jar of oil, a bottle of Pam, or any soaked rag of oil and then apply it directly to the metal. After
doing this, make sure to get a wood burning fire going to ensure al… BBQ DropoutI usually try to clean it before every cook to
ensure proper seasoning of the metal which will start to prolong it’s life. Taking that into consideration and assuming you have
cleaned the smoker - just make sure to get it to the right temperature before actually placing the Smoked Picanha on the grates. 

> What temperature should I start smoking the Picanha at?


It’s honestly a really subjective measure, but what I mean is to just let the grate get hot enough to ensure an efficient cook
with no wasted time waiting for it to get up to a hot enough temperature. For those that want specificity - just make sure it’s at
least 225 degrees Fahrenheit.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMOKING PICANHA - OAK WOOD AND CHARCOAL
Whatever you decide to start smoking your picanha on - make sure to consider the type of wood and charcoal being used. This will
play a pivotal role in the flavor profile for your epically smoked picanha! Being in Central Texas, Oak wood is by far my favorite
wood to use.

> How do I actually start the oak wood and charcoal?


Well, you want to begin with your charcoal. I like to get a bag from HEB (my local grocery store) and pour it into a Weber chimney
starter. To get the briquettes to light up - if you happen to have a burner on a propane grill, you can actually just place it on
top of it to expedite them getting lit.

Wait a couple of minutes - usually it takes about 10 minutes or so for the briquettes to fully ignite. Once you see an orange
tinted set of flames coming from your chimney starter - it’s time to run over to your smoker and pour it in the firebox.

PRO TIP: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL OF YOUR SMOKER DOORS WIDE OPEN FOR MAXIMUM AIRFLOW!
Here’s what it should look like:

Smoking Picanha on Offset SmokerAfter waiting several minutes for the briquettes to start heating your smoker - go ahead and grab
a couple of oak logs. Place them however you like on top of the briquettes and wait another 10 minutes or so. Make sure your vents
are wide open - what you want to see when you come back is the wood burning with an orange flame. Better yet, if the wood is
starting to get a white ash on it - that is when you know your wood and charcoal are properly started!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMOKING PICANHA - KOSHER SALT AND BLACK PEPPER
Kosher Salt and Black Pepper is a staple in Central Texas. Therefore, that is the primary base for which every cut of meat I cook
will have. Of course, you can certainly have OTHER types of seasonings - my preference is just this simple recipe. 

As such, below is the specific shaker bottle I use:

Season the entirety of your picanha to ensure maximum flavor! This is something not many do. Don’t worry about over seasoning your
meat. I’ve definitely had an under seasoned cut of meat and hardly any that I would classify as over seasoned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMOKING PICANHA - THERMOMETER
To get a perfectly smoked picanha - don’t forget your thermometer!

I personally love to use the MEATER Thermometer. It’s a fantastic tool that directly integrates with your iPhone or android, and
provides you with prompt updates through their app that you can have installed. It measures the ambient and internal temperatures
of both your smoked picanha and offset smoker - and even notifies you when approximately the cook will end so you can plan ahead. 

Here’s what it looks like:

Smoking Picanha on a Smoker - MEATER Thermometer It comes in a lovely bamboo style box that actually charges the utensil. It’s a
fantastic piece of equipment and a TOTAL GAME CHANGER!

> Where do I place it in the Picanha?


Just find the thickest part of the meat - and slide it in. The thermometer will begin to start picking up the internal and ambient
temperature.

SMOKING PICANHA - RESULTS
The result of your hard work should be an absolutely incredible piece of meat. A smoked picanha should have a savory flavor note
from the oak wood, along with a great flavor profile from the Kosher Salt and Black Pepper. Simply amazing.

It measures the ambient and internal temperatures of both your smoked picanha and offset smoker - and even notifies you when approximately the cook will end so you can plan ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image-gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;margin-top:0&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;flex:0.75 1 0;margin-left:0&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;2016&quot; width=&quot;1512&quot; style=&quot;height:100%;width:100%&quot; src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1619991032610.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;flex:0.46205357142857145 1 0;margin-left:10px&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1792&quot; width=&quot;828&quot; style=&quot;height:100%;width:100%&quot; src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1619991042017.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Smoking Picanha on a Smoker - MEATER  Thermometer &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes in a lovely bamboo style box that actually charges the utensil.

There are several types of Picanha Cuts:

 * Individual Picanha Steaks
 * Picanha Roasts
 * Brazillian Steakhouse Style Picanha


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE DIFFERENT PICANHA CUTS - INDIVIDIUAL PICANHA STEAKS
What exactly are Picanha steaks? Essentially whenever you go to the store and see top sirloin cuts - that’s what a Picanha steak
is. What that means is that the Picanha is really a term loosely applied to what is better known as the Top Sirloin cut of meat. 

There are a variety of ways to prepare a Picanha Steak - or Top Sirloin Steak - the most popular of which is to just throw it on
the grill at a decent temperature, and be sure to effectively cook them about 5 minutes on each side.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE DIFFERENT PICANHA CUTS - PICANHA ROAST
This particular cut of Picanha is my absolute favorite. The Picanha roast is another term coined for the Top Sirloin Cap.
Basically, it’s just a giant roast of Top Sirloin with the Fat cap still attached to the top of the meat. 

The fat cap is really what makes this one of my FAVORITE cuts of meat currently. That’s honestly saying a lot. 

Here’s a good picture I like to use to showcase exactly what a Picanha Roast is:

Picanha RoastAs you can see, this particular cut of Picanha is really just a giant roast. The fat cap is clearly still intact, and
even drapes over the edges. It truly is an amazing piece of meat.

Alright … Now on to the next section - I will be discussing the most famed version of the Picanha Cuts.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE DIFFERENT PICANHA CUTS - BRAZILIAN CHURRASCARIA
Ever been to a Brazilian Steakhouse and see the guys walking around with these large skewers of meat? Well, come to find out - one
of the main cuts of meat served on those glorious blades is actually Picanha!

Churrascaria is essentially a certain technique where someone cuts up the Picanha Roast as a whole - and packages it up into thick
steak chunks. Once they do that, they get one of those skewers you see throughout the restaurants, roll up the chunks and skewer
all the pieces together. Before presenting it to you, they obviously have to cook it.

The Gaucho’s (Brazilian word for Cowboy) then start to grill the Picanha over an open flame while the skewer is rotating
rotisserie style.

In short, Brazilian Churrascaria is a different way to cook and prepare the Picanha Cut.]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/what-are-the-different-picanha-cuts/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/what-are-the-different-picanha-cuts/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 14:25:28 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several types of Picanha Cuts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Picanha Steaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picanha Roasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazillian Steakhouse Style Picanha&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Different Picanha Cuts - Individiual Picanha Steaks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What exactly are Picanha steaks?

To get an amazingly juicy, tender, and grilled picanha - you are going to want to first of all cook it to roughly 135 to 145
degrees Fahrenheit. Before cooking however, make sure you get the right cut of picanha. Specifically, go to your local store and
request a top sirloin cap. This will ensure that the fat cap is adequate and will provide a better flavor profile for the meat.
Once you have acquired the right cut, go ahead and season it with the famed Kosher Salt and Black Pepper. THEN you can place it
upon your grill for cooking. There’s no real science behind this method. Just get the right cut, season properly, and let it sit
on the grill.

COOKING GRILLED PICANHA - GETTING STARTED
> Ever wonder how to cook Picanha on the Grill? 


Here’s how:

 * Acquire the right Cut of Picanha
 * Proper Seasoning - Kosher Salt & Black Pepper
 * Weber Grill 
 * Remote Meat Thermometer


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COOKING GRILLED PICANHA - HOW TO GET THE RIGHT PICANHA CUT OF MEAT
This is actually harder than it seems… 

All you need to do is head over to your nearest grocery store or meat market - and request the following:

> Picanha OR Top Sirloin Cap


Why is this harder than it seems? Picanha is really not that well known.

 I know. Crazy. 

What this means is you either have to end up clarifying to those at the meat counter that you want a Top Sirloin Cap, or call
ahead of time to ensure that they even have that cut to begin with. Usually, a meat market worker will either just not be aware
what it even is or they are completely out of stock. These are just some common pain points that I have come across, especially
since most often than not - it’s not out on the market floor display.

how to cook grilled Picanha - vacuumed sealedThe above is a picture of what my local grocery store has available in the back - all
vacuumed sealed and ready to go. Notice the very large fat cap on those bad boys. Once you are at this stage of the process, you
are well on your way to eating VERY well.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COOKING GRILLED PICANHA - KOSHER SALT AND BLACK PEPPER
Want to know what the BEST seasoning to use on a Picanha? 

Kosher Salt and Black Pepper. Here’s the specific bottle I use:

how to cook grilled Picanha - Seasoning As you can see, this is from HEB. This is a highly effective mix of seasoning. Being in
Central Texas - this is standard for essentially ANY cook. If you don’t have the fortune of being close to an HEB, just go pick up
the ingredients separately. Once you have the ingredients, make sure to SEASON PROPERLY. 

> How do I season properly?


Simple. Just make sure you get enough of the seasoning to cover the entirety of the meat. Keep sprinkling until there are hardly
any open spaces of meat exposed. THAT is how you season properly. In short, just douse the whole thing in your seasoning. Don’t
worry, the results will be fantastic!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COOKING GRILLED PICANHA - REMOTE MEAT THERMOMETER
> What meat thermometer exactly? 


My all time favorite - the MEATER Thermometer. It’s an awesome wireless meat probe that integrates directly with your smart phone.
The MEATER Probe is also able to measure the internal and ambient temperature of your meat simultaneously. Truly amazing.

To source this, you can either go to amazon or a local Barbecue shop. Mine was actually gifted to me, but I will be buying more
very soon! 

Whatever thermometer you happen to be using, just go ahead and insert it, set the appropriate configurations, and Grill the
Picanha until your desired temperature. For this cook, the Picanha was grilled until roughly 145 degrees Fahrenheit.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COOKING GRILLED PICANHA - WEBER GRILL
> How to properly grill a Picanha on a Weber grill?


I’ll be happy to show you how! Essentially, once you are done prepping your Picanha - meaning the seasoning and thermometer are
positioned correctly - go ahead and just slap it on the grates. 

My Weber grill is a three knob - there are three knobs to modify the actually propane being emitted. This just ensures a certain
degree of temperature control to make sure you don’t cook your meat TOO fast. Roughly speaking, this cook too about 30 minutes to
cook all the way through. There’s nothing too complicated about this step either. Just make sure you are flipping the roast every
5 minutes or so to ensure an even cook. You definitely don’t want to have an over-charred 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COOKING GRILLED PICANHA - RESULTS!!
Like the above photo? I do too! Once the Picanha was removed from the heat for resting - I wated approximately 15 minutes to
ensure the temperatures could settle down. Once that happened, I was able to slice it to perfection.

TL;DR
The purpose of this blog post is to show people how to cook the Picanha Cut of meat. There are many different ways to cook it, but
for now - we are doing it in the oven. When cooking the Picanha Cut, you will want to make sure that you first and foremost cook
it to the right temperature. What temperature? Just make sure it comes up to at least 135 degrees Fahrenheit. For prepping the
meat - I like to use Kosher Salt & Black Pepper with a sprinkle of Garlic powder. Basically, just grab the Picanha Cut, and
promptly lather the entirety of the meat with the seasoning until you see absolutely zero red. At this point, the Picanha Cut is
now completely seasoned and is ALMOST ready to place in your cooking device - I used an oven for this cook. Before actually
cooking, make sure to WRAP the Picanha Cut in aluminum foil. Cook the Picanha Cut at an approximate ambient temperature of 400
degrees Fahrenheit and let it rip until it hits your desired temperature. Just make sure to let it rest for around 20 minutes
before slicing.

DONE!!

PICANHA CUT - GETTING STARTED
Alright!

My favorite part of my blog posts - how to get started cooking a Picanha Cut of meat!

What you need:

 * Picanha Cut (Duh)
 * Oven
 * Aluminum Foil
 * Kosher Salt & Black Pepper
 * Thermometer


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PICANHA CUT - KOSHER SALT & BLACK PEPPER SEASONING
Whoohooo! Seasoning my FAVORITE piece of meat - the Picanha Cut. 

To properly season this beautiful piece of meat - make sure you head on over to your favorite grocery store and take a gander upon
the meat selection. Depending on how sophisticated they are - you may or may not see it out on display. Bummer. It’s Okay though!
Just go to the counter and ask the specifically for either:

“Picanha Cut” OR “Top Sirloin Cap”

Sometimes, those behind the meat counter will not actually be aware what a Picanha Cut actually is. Once you have acquired the 
Picanha Cut, make sure when you’re ready to season it - you have a mixer bottle comprised of Kosher Salt & Black Pepper. Don’t
forget the Garlic Powder as well!

Determining the correct amount of Seasoning for the Picanha Cut is really pretty simple. Grab your Seasoning ingredients and just
sprinkle it all over the meat until it gets to a point where the entire surface area is completely covered. Don’t worry about
measurements … every piece is different. That being said, just grab your bottle and get seasoning!

This is what the Picanha Cut should look like:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PICANHA CUT - ALUMINUM FOIL METHOD
Now that your Picanha Cut has been seasoned properly, let’s talk about the Aluminum Foil Method. What does that even mean? It
basically is a way to ensure that your cut of meat is adequately wrapped in Aluminum Foil. This helps to ensure that a good amount
of the moisture inside the meat is effectively trapped inside. You don’t want your Picanha Cut to come out dry do you? Nope!

Wrapping the meat is fairly straight forward. Get a standard thing of Aluminum Foil from your local grocery store and make sure to
pull out about a foot or two in length. Place your Picanha on one end, and make sure to start tucking the edges around the
entirety of the meat, keep rolling it, and you should have something like you see below:

Cooking the Picanha Cut - foil wrap
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PICANHA CUT - THERMOMETER
Time to measure the temperature! This is one of the most critical parts of cooking ANY cut of meat. It can actually get somewhat
complicated, but a general rule of thump is to cook this specific cut of meat - to a temperature of roughly 135 Degrees
Fahrenheit. This will ensure it is Medium to Medium-Rare. 

What thermometer does the BBQ Dropout actually use? All kinds. But more often than not … will use the MEATER made thermometer.
This is the BEST thermometer on the market, and I have tried a lot of them. 

Shortly after wrapping your Picanha Cut with aluminum foil, simply insert your MEATER probe. Once completed, just check your app
on your phone and set the cut of meat to ‘Picanha’. Promptly select your desired temperature (in this case - 135 degrees
Fahrenheit) and place in the oven!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PICANHA CUT - OVEN
Alright, you have acquired your meat - the foil - the thermometer - now what?

Simple.

Just place your cut into the oven, and bake it at roughly 400 degrees Fahrenheit. There are a variety of ways to cook the meat -
low and slow - hot and fast - etc. The approach you will generally see on here is a hot and fast approach. This means baking it at
fairly high temperatures to ensure a timely cook. Definitely do not want to be cooking for several hours!

Once your Picanha has finally come up to temp, go ahead and pull it from the oven.

Just make sure to let it rest for around 20 minutes before slicing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picanha Cut - Getting Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;youTube-8Xl57WaOARA&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Xl57WaOARA&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of my blog posts - how to get started cooking a &lt;strong&gt;Picanha Cut&lt;/strong&gt; of meat&lt;strong&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picanha Cut (Duh)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oven&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aluminum Foil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kosher Salt &amp;amp; Black Pepper&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thermometer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picanha Cut - Kosher Salt &amp;amp; Black Pepper Seasoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoohooo! Seasoning my FAVORITE piece of meat - the &lt;strong&gt;Picanha Cut.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To properly season this beautiful piece of meat - make sure you head on over to your favorite grocery store and take a gander upon the meat selection. Depending on how sophisticated they are - you may or may not see it out on display. Bummer. It’s Okay though! Just go to the counter and ask the specifically for either:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Picanha Cut” OR “Top Sirloin Cap”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, those behind the meat counter will not actually be aware what a &lt;strong&gt;Picanha Cut&lt;/strong&gt; actually is. Once you have acquired the &lt;strong&gt;Picanha Cut&lt;/strong&gt;, make sure when you’re ready to season it - you have a mixer bottle comprised of Kosher Salt &amp;amp; Black Pepper. Don’t forget the Garlic Powder as well!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the correct amount of Seasoning for the &lt;strong&gt;Picanha Cut&lt;/strong&gt; is really pretty simple. Grab your Seasoning ingredients and just sprinkle it all over the meat until it gets to a point where the entire surface area is completely covered. Don’t worry about measurements … every piece is different. That being said, just grab your bottle and get seasoning!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is what the Picanha Cut should look like:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;default-size-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1619989619414.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Cooking the Picanha Cut - Seasoning&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Picanha Cut - Aluminum Foil Method&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that your Picanha Cut has been seasoned properly, let’s talk about the Aluminum Foil Method. What does that even mean? It basically is a way to ensure that your cut of meat is adequately wrapped in Aluminum Foil. This helps to ensure that a good amount of the moisture inside the meat is effectively trapped inside. You don’t want your Picanha Cut to come out dry do you? Nope!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrapping the meat is fairly straight forward. Get a standard thing of Aluminum Foil from your local grocery store and make sure to pull out about a foot or two in length. Place your Picanha on one end, and make sure to start tucking the edges around the entirety of the meat, keep rolling it, and you should have something like you see below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;default-size-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1619989662861.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Cooking the Picanha Cut - foil wrap&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Picanha Cut - Thermometer&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to measure the temperature! This is one of the most critical parts of cooking ANY cut of meat. It can actually get somewhat complicated, but a general rule of thump is to cook this specific cut of meat - to a temperature of roughly 135 Degrees Fahrenheit. This will ensure it is Medium to Medium-Rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What thermometer does the BBQ Dropout actually use? All kinds. But more often than not … will use the MEATER made thermometer. This is the BEST thermometer on the market, and I have tried a lot of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after wrapping your Picanha Cut with aluminum foil, simply insert your MEATER probe. Once completed, just check your app on your phone and set the cut of meat to ‘Picanha’. Promptly select your desired temperature (in this case - 135 degrees Fahrenheit) and place in the oven!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Picanha Cut - Oven&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, you have acquired your meat - the foil - the thermometer - now what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just place your cut into the oven, and bake it at roughly 400 degrees Fahrenheit. There are a variety of ways to cook the meat - low and slow - hot and fast - etc. The approach you will generally see on here is a hot and fast approach. This means baking it at fairly high temperatures to ensure a timely cook. Definitely do not want to be cooking for several hours!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your Picanha has finally come up to temp, go ahead and pull it from the oven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Cook Brisket in the Oven?]]></title><description><![CDATA[TL;DR
To cook an amazing brisket in the oven, all you have to do is season it properly. I used the Standard Texas seasoning - Kosher
Salt and Black Pepper. Make sure you thoroughly season your brisket. Turn your oven on to around 400 degrees and let it come fully
up to that temperature before placing your Brisket inside. Get some foil and wrap the entire piece of meat. Once you have wrapped
your brisket, place it in the oven and wait until the internal temperature has come up to the famed 200 degrees internal
temperature. At that point, the brisket in the oven should now be ready to be pulled. From that point, just let it rest for a
couple hours and you’re done! Enjoy!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRISKET IN THE OVEN - GETTING STARTED:
Alright! Let’s get cook some amazing Brisket … in the OVEN! Woah. Does it have smoke flavor? Nope - BUT it does have all the same
consistency as a normal smoked Brisket. A Brisket in the oven does have the same flavor profile - for the most part - and has the
potential to really come out great. The one I used for this blog post came out with amazingly crisp and tasty BARK. Not only that,
just about every piece of it was incredibly moist. 

How did I get an amazingly tender Brisket in the Oven?

Simple:

 * Brisket Flat
 * Oven
 * Kosher Salt & Black Pepper
 * Thermometer


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRISKET IN THE OVEN - BRISKET FLAT
What is a Brisket Flat?

A Brisket Flat is just the ‘leaner’ portion of the overall Brisket. If you didn’t know, a Brisket is a giant muscle with two parts
- the Flat and the Point. The Flat is the leaner part, while the Point of the Brisket is way more fatty. For this blog post, I
used just a Brisket Flat.

Specifically, the Brisket Flat used was a great looking Prime grade Brisket. Basically, I just cut it in half and cooked the point
at a later time and just was trying to cook the Flat in the oven. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRISKET IN THE OVEN - OVEN TEMPERATURE
Okay the cooking device .. the Oven! They’re actually not that bad. I used to be a BBQ SNOB before becoming the BBQ DROPOUT. Once
you realize that there are actually OTHER ways and methods to cook a traditional piece of BARBECUE, the whole world seems to open
up. 

Why is that?

 First of, all not everyone has a Smoker. Second of all, not every one has the time to use a smoker. Not only that, maybe they
don’t want to smell like smoke all day? 

All of that is totally fine.

Now, about the OVEN. What do you need to do? 

Just go to the temperature interface, and select your preferred temperature. For this cook, I used the glorious setting of 400
degrees. This is commonly known as a ‘hot and fast’ cook. Basically, instead of cooking the Brisket in the Oven for the entire day
.. it just takes a measly couple hours AND you get the same result as the ‘low and slow’ method. Over the course of all of my blog
posts, you’ll see that the BBQ DROPOUT prefers the Hot and Fast method.

Before placing your Brisket in the oven, just make sure that the oven temperature comes fully to temp. This is to ensure that you
don’t waste any time while your brisket is in the oven. Usually, if you were to put your Brisket I have found that it may even
slightly decrease the ambient temperature in the oven, thus taking a lot longer for it to come back to temperature. Therefore, I
try to just make sure the Oven is at 400 degrees, THEN I put the Brisket in the Oven.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRISKET IN THE OVEN - KOSHER SALT & BLACK PEPPER
Kosher Salt & Black Pepper - BBQ DROPOUT’S favorite seasoning! Why is that? It is the quintessential Central Texas Seasoning. Ever
heard of the saying .. good BBQ doesn’t need BBQ Sauce? That’s because Kosher Salt & Black Pepper is the ONLY seasoning you will
ever need. That being said, can you still make BBQ with more ingredients? Of course! You’re on BBQDROPOUT.com. It shouldn’t matter
WHAT seasoning you’re using. I just really like Kosher Salt & Black Pepper Since it’s plain, simple, and produces AMAZING RESULTS.

BBQ DROPOUT usually sources his Seasoning from his local grocery store. Being in Central Texas, this is H-E-B (the best grocery
store in the world). Fortunately, they actually just came out with an already blended shaker bottle filled with an even amount of
Kosher Salt & Black Pepper. Just head on over to your local grocery store, see if they have a bottle such as that and if they
don’t - just pick up the two separate ingredients and mix it 50/50 yourself.

OKAY - Actually seasoning the Brisket Flat

I really try to thoroughly season any kind of cut that’s traditionally used for Barbecuing. When cuts like Brisket aren’t seasoned
really well, it just tastes mediocre - and the entire cook was basically a waste. To make sure this never happens, I always try to
potentially even OVER season the Brisket to cover my bases. I don’t think I’ve ever had a Brisket that was OVER SEASONED but have
definitely had an UNDER SEASONED Brisket. For calculating exact amounts of seasons to apply, I can’t give you any. Every cut is
different. Each piece of meat has different sizes, fat - protein ratios, different grades - the list goes on. So a good ball park
estimate is to just pour as much of it on the Brisket as you can and make sure all of the surface area is very well covered in
Kosher Salt & Black Pepper.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRISKET IN THE OVEN - THERMOMETER
Measuring Brisket Temperatures .. How do you accomplish this? 

Well, with a thermometer of course! Which one? I personally have used ALL kinds. You’d be surprised how large the thermometer
market actually is. As of this current date of writing this blog post, I actually have started using the MEATER-MADE thermometer.
Great piece of technology. It’s basically just a wireless thermometer that you can just set and forget - set it inside the meat
and just get updates through your phone when the internal temperature goes past a certain threshold. 

Besides using the wireless thermometer, I also like to use a ThermoPop style thermometer. This is more for ad-hoc style of probing
the meat. With the MEATER-MADE thermometer, it’s more to measure the temperature at a constant threshold. With the ThermoPop style
of thermometers, not only can you just probe around the meat in various areas, but can also serve as a way to just gauge whether
or not the brisket is ‘probing tender’ - which is a very important thing to consider when measuring the done-ness of ANY brisket
you cook.

Alright, using a thermometer - there’s two things to consider that I just mentioned above.

Firstly, just make sure your Brisket is temping out at around - roughly speaking of course - 200 degrees Fahrenheit. This is
generally speaking the temperature at which point the collagen inside the brisket will breakdown and produce AMAZING results. As I
mentioned before however, each brisket is different. Which brings me to my second point.

Make sure you can stick your other ad-hoc style thermometer in like it’s a stick of butter. Basically, this will ensure that the
brisket is PROPE TENDER and will help serve as another safeguard to ensure you are cooking a fantastic brisket in the oven.

THE RESULTS? I AM SO GLAD YOU ASKED:

Learn how to effectively clean and protect an offset smoker!

All you need to do for cleaning an offset smoker is to grab a jar of oil, a bottle of Pam, or any soaked rag of oil and then apply
it directly to the metal. After doing this, make sure to get a wood burning fire going to ensure all the metal is HOT. That will
ensure that the oil can infuse with the metal, thus stopping rust from forming further. Congrats! You now have a cleaned offset
smoker! Pro-Tip: do this before every cook!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLEANING OFFSET SMOKER - GETTING STARTED:
Cleaning a smoker is a very important task. Often, once you are done smoking your beautiful piece of meat, there will be a
significant amount of ash. Leaving this material in your smoker firebox for extended periods of time WILL cause rust accumulation
and metal breakdown. NOT GOOD! To fix this, you have to tend further to your smoker. By applying certain techniques to your smoker
to remediate rust build up, you are able to ensure your smoker will last probably longer than you will live - meaning it will
outlive you if you take care of it. 

Now, how do I clean my smoker? Make sure you have the following at your disposal:

 *  Offset Smoker
 *  Pam Oil/Jar of Oil/Rag dipped in oil
 *  Wood to get fire started
 *  Wire Brush


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLEANING OFFSET SMOKER - PREPPING YOUR PIT
To effectively begin the process of cleaning your pit, you are going to want to make sure the outside of your smoker has been
scrubbed all the way down with your wire brush. To do this, grab your wire brush and start applying it directly to the metal.
Don’t worry about scratching anything - your pit is SOLID STEEL. Essentially, it is indestructible and the wire brush really won’t
have any effect on degrading the integrity of the metal. 

Usually, an offset smoker’s metal is about one-quarter-inch (1/4) in thickness. So really, DON’T worry about hurting your pit. 

Okay, so now that you have grabbed your wire brush, start scrubbing that bad boy. What do I mean by scrubbing? Literally just
start scrubbing all throughout the surface area of your offset smoker. Wherever you see rust accumulating, start scrubbing that
area. You will quickly start to see rust particles emit from the surface of your offset smoker. This is a good sign. Keep applying
this technique to the metal, and all areas of the smoker where you see rust. Once completed, you are ready for the next steps in
the process.

Here’s a picture notating what the smoker firebox should now look like:

How to clean an Offset Smoker - Fire boxNotice how it almost looks like dust? That’s what it looks like. Basically, it seems like
it’s just removing the rust from the metal. I primarily focused on the firebox, since that is where a lot of the rust accumulation
has taken place. 

Here’s an aerial view of the overall smoker:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLEANING OFFSET SMOKER - GETTING FIREBOX TURNED UP
Now that you have done such a great job scrubbing your offset smoker with your wire brush, you will want to get the heat cranked
up to a very HOT degree. To do this, grab some wood - Any wood will do - light it, and make sure all the vents and grates are wide
open to ensure maximum airflow. This will help catch the wood on fire. Wait about 20-30 minutes. In the meantime, go grab a beer
or a Coke Zero. When you come back and find your smoker blazing, that’s great news! Close all your grates, but leave your vents
open to ensure the wood can still get some Oxygen flow. This just ensures a clean and consistent fire. Now you are ready for the
final step.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLEANING OFFSET SMOKER - APPLYING OIL TO THE METAL
Time for the final step!

Grab your oil and make sure you’re ready to apply it all over your Offset Smoker. For me, I just use Pam. Using the spray can as
opposed to getting a mop to get it on the Smoker really lets you get all the hard to get spots. However, if you don’t have Pam
readily available, feel free to use any type of oil you may have in the house. Some good options are vegetable oil, coconut oil,
and olive oil. Just make sure you can baste it all over the Smoker. 

Since the smoker has now been scrapped down with the wire brush and a wood fire is currently burning, go ahead and spray all over
the smoker. You should notice that as the oil is hitting the metal, it’s almost like it’s getting rehydrated. In fact that’s
exactly what is happening. The metal needs moisture. Getting oil infused into the metal produces this rehydration effect, where it
not only repels any further rust for the time being, but it also makes it look like the smoker is brand new! Really, take a look
at your smoker now. It’s all dark, sleek and shiny looking as opposed to before. 

CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE NOW EFFECTIVELY CLEANED YOUR OFFSET SMOKER!
How to clean an Offset SmokerNOW THAT YOU HAVE WONDERFULLY CLEANED AN OFFSET SMOKER, HERE’S SOME QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD BE ASKING
YOURSELF:
 1. How often should I clean my offset smoker?
 2. Should you clean your smoker racks?
 3. How do you keep a firebox from rusting?
 4. Do I need to season my smoker?
 5. What is the best oil to season a smoker with?

These are all VERY important! Offset Smoker maintenance does not end with just a single cleaning session. There are a variety of
ways to clean an offset smoker, not just including the list made above. 

Alright, let’s dive deeper in to how to clean an offset smoker.

HOW OFTEN SHOULD I CLEAN MY OFFSET SMOKER?
You should be cleaning your offset smoker every cook. It took a long time for myself to figure this one out, but it is absolutely
essential. The reasoning behind this suggestion is not to burden you with more tasks by cleaning an offset smoker, but to ensure
the longevity of your cooking device. Offset smokers are a fantastic product that you want to use to cook amazing barbecue,
therefore it becomes imperative to always stay up to date with your cleaning. Not only that, there are a variety of ways to make
sure that your offset smoker is always cleaned. There are different types of oils, wire brushes, parts of the smoker that need
more tending to, the list really goes on.

To break it down, here’s a rule of thumb for how often offset smoker cleaning must occur:

art of cleaning an offset smoker. As you can tell, not all parts of the smoker actually need to be cleaned at a frequency of ever
cook. Taking a look at the above table, you can see that the part of the smoker that needs the most attention is the firebox. 

> Why does an offset smoker firebox need to be cleaned so frequently?


Great question! 

The reason you have to clean a firebox so frequently is due to all of the ash that gets generated directly on that portion of the
smoker. Charcoal and wood both leave residue in the form of ash that will start eating away at the metal inside your offset
smoker. 

The other parts of the smoker, as you can see, do not need as frequent of a cleaning. That’s most likely due to there not being
ash touching the metal in those areas. You can even see on the table, that the firebox grates need to be cleaned as well. That is
again because of their proximity to the ASH! 

So sum this up with regards to the frequency of how often you should be cleaning an offset smoker :

Just make sure you are applying a wire brush directly to the firebox and firebox grates before or after every cook! While doing
this, also make sure to apply Pam oil spray or any kind of vegetable oil spray directly to the metal before heating it up.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SHOULD YOU CLEAN YOUR SMOKER RACKS?
Another fantastic question!

Yes, you should be cleaning your smoker racks. But the real question becomes - which smoker racks should you be giving more
attention to and how often? Also, some may be wondering how to clean smoker grates at all?

Those are all valid points. 

You should be focusing on the grates nearest to the firebox. These are generally the ones that are in close proximity to any ash
left behind during the cook. Remember, ASH is what causes your offset smoker to become dirty and rusty! To clean the actual smoker
grates, you’ll want to take your wire brush and start directly applying it to your equipment. Start scraping and brushing over
both sides of the metal.

Once you have began actually cleaning the most rust covered smoking rack, you should start to see the metal start shedding the
rust particles. The rust on your rack will actually start to form some kind of powder. Take advantage of the rust being scraped
off by cementing oil into the wrought iron. 

Find your nearest bottle of Pam, and take your smoker rack over by the grass. Lay it down, and start spraying it all over. This
should ensure you don’t miss any spots, and it is an even surface that you can use to set the grate down on.

HOW DO YOU KEEP A FIREBOX FROM RUSTING?
When you are trying to clean your offset smoker, you will quickly discover that fire pit rust is very prominent. Not only that,
it’s quite frankly a PAIN! It seems like almost every cook you are having to constantly tend to your smoker’s firebox and stop the
fire pit itself from rusting. Despite this constant pain, there are some remedies and offset smoker maintenance techniques that
you can administer. These generally include oiling the entirety of the fire pit and actually cleaning out ALL ash present.

TO PREVENT FIRE PIT RUST YOU WILL WANT TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:
How much of the offset smoker firebox is actually covered in rust and how much ash is present inside. 

You will want to begin removing all of the ash immediately. To do this, I would recommend grabbing an ash bucket from your local
grocery store. They’re usually pretty cheap, no more than $10-20 and can last quite a while if you take care of them.

INSERT ASHBUCKET PICTURE HERE

Above you can see a really nice looking ash bucket for the offset smoker, that allows for rapid exiting of all ash present. Doing
this will only help you eliminate all fire pit rust from accumulating. I can’t guarantee that rust will NEVER start to accumulate
again after doing this, but I can guarantee that your fire pit box metal will not be slowly eroded away. Yes, ash can eat
completely through your quarter inch thick steel of your smoker overtime. This is why it is critical to clean it out!

> How do you dispose of ashes from a smoker?


You can dispose of ashes from a smoker by pouring it into an ash bucket. I like to grab a small shovel and start scraping it out
of the fire pit itself and into the ash bucket. You’re also going to want to make sure that you wait about 12-24 hours after you
have stopped your cook. This is because although the ash is inside the bucket, you can never be too certain that the ash isn’t
still active. Basically, you really want to make sure that the ash isn’t hot and has the potential to start a fire once you
finally dispose of it.

A common method of disposing of ashes from a smoker is to simply throw it away in a trash bag. This is the simplistic way of doing
it, but you can also use it as fertilizer. Disposing of ash as fertilizer is a great way to recycle your wood and also help your
grass or garden grow. Super cool stuff!

Before you start oiling your fire pit - go ahead and just check how much rust is actually on it. This will give you an idea of how
often you potentially need to be actively trying to prevent fire pit rust. If the rust is starting to accumulate in splotchy areas
- it may not need as frequent cleaning. If the fire pit is rusted all over - that should serve as a pretty clear indicator that
you should always be cleaning it.

Alright, that’s the first way of helping to prevent fire pit rust. On to the second recommendation. Oiling the entirety of the
pit. 

OILING A FIRE PIT
> Should I oil my fire pit?


You should always be oiling your fire pit. This will help to cure and season your smoker and firebox. In addition to cleaning out
the ash out of your fire pit - you will be helping the iron to seal the porous surface area from accumulating any rusty particles.
Science!!

> What kind of oil do you put in a fire pit?


Pam oil is the recommended type of oil to put in a fire pit. You don’t HAVE to use this specific type of oil, it’s just really
easy to get all the hard to reach areas that you normally can’t get with basting other types of oil.

In practice, to help deter fire pit rust you will want to grab the Pam oil or whatever type of oil you have at hand. Promptly
start spreading it all over the metal, and just ensure that once you have the oil on over the fire box, you can rest assured that
you can start to eliminate fire pit rust.

DO I NEED TO SEASON MY SMOKER?
You should always be re seasoning a smoker when you have the chance. Actually, many of the steps above play directly into
seasoning your smoker. You’re going to want to apply all of these steps every cook. If you don’t have the time to clean your
smoker and especially season your smoker - don’t worry too much. The most important thing is to get all of the ash out of your
fire box. I really can’t stress how important that part is.

If you are just starting out and have a brand new smoker - it’s very common to hear that you should be oiling it all over. It
basically just imparts more flavor onto all of your cooks by capturing a lot of smoke and other meat residue onto the metal.
Seasoning your offset smoker creates a prime environment for cooking amazing barbecue.

After doing this, make sure to get a wood burning fire going to ensure all the metal is HOT. That will ensure that the oil can infuse with the metal, thus stopping rust from forming further. Congrats! You now have a cleaned offset smoker! Pro-Tip: do this before every cook!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleaning Offset Smoker&lt;/strong&gt; - Getting Started:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;youTube-EgnuggSQx0Q&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EgnuggSQx0Q&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleaning a smoker is a very important task. Often, once you are done smoking your beautiful piece of meat, there will be a significant amount of ash. Leaving this material in your smoker firebox for extended periods of time WILL cause rust accumulation and metal breakdown. NOT GOOD! To fix this, you have to tend further to your smoker. By applying certain techniques to your smoker to remediate rust build up, you are able to ensure your smoker will last probably longer than you will live - meaning it will outlive you if you take care of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, how do I clean my smoker? Make sure you have the following at your disposal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;contains-task-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;&quot;/&gt; Offset Smoker&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;&quot;/&gt; Pam Oil/Jar of Oil/Rag dipped in oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;&quot;/&gt; Wood to get fire started&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;&quot;/&gt; Wire Brush&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleaning Offset Smoker - Prepping your pit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively begin the process of cleaning your pit, you are going to want to make sure the outside of your smoker has been scrubbed all the way down with your wire brush. To do this, grab your wire brush and start applying it directly to the metal. Don’t worry about scratching anything - your pit is SOLID STEEL. Essentially, it is indestructible and the wire brush really won’t have any effect on degrading the integrity of the metal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, an offset smoker’s metal is about one-quarter-inch (1/4) in thickness. So really, DON’T worry about hurting your pit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now that you have grabbed your wire brush, start scrubbing that bad boy. What do I mean by scrubbing? Literally just start scrubbing all throughout the surface area of your offset smoker. Wherever you see rust accumulating, start scrubbing that area. You will quickly start to see rust particles emit from the surface of your offset smoker. This is a good sign. Keep applying this technique to the metal, and all areas of the smoker where you see rust. Once completed, you are ready for the next steps in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a  picture notating what the smoker firebox should now look like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;default-size-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1619987454471.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;How to clean an Offset Smoker - Fire box&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how it almost looks like dust? That’s what it looks like. Basically, it seems like it’s just removing the rust from the metal. I primarily focused on the firebox, since that is where a lot of the rust accumulation has taken place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an aerial view of the overall smoker:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;default-size-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1619987589319.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;How to clean an Offset Smoker&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleaning  Offset Smoker&lt;/strong&gt; - Getting Firebox Turned Up&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have done such a great job scrubbing your offset smoker with your wire brush, you will want to get the heat cranked up to a very HOT degree. To do this, grab some wood - Any wood will do - light it, and make sure all the vents and grates are wide open to ensure maximum airflow. This will help catch the wood on fire. Wait about 20-30 minutes. In the meantime, go grab a beer or a Coke Zero. When you come back and find your smoker blazing, that’s great news! Close all your grates, but leave your vents open to ensure the wood can still get some Oxygen flow. This just ensures a clean and consistent fire. Now you are ready for the final step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Cleaning Offset Smoker - Applying Oil To The Metal&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time for the final step!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grab your oil and make sure you’re ready to apply it all over your Offset Smoker. For me, I just use Pam. Using the spray can as opposed to getting a mop to get it on the Smoker really lets you get all the hard to get spots. However, if you don’t have Pam readily available, feel free to use any type of oil you may have in the house. Some good options are vegetable oil, coconut oil, and olive oil. Just make sure you can baste it all over the Smoker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the smoker has now been scrapped down with the wire brush and a wood fire is currently burning, go ahead and spray all over the smoker. You should notice that as the oil is hitting the metal, it’s almost like it’s getting rehydrated. In fact that’s exactly what is happening. The metal needs moisture. Getting oil infused into the metal produces this rehydration effect, where it not only repels any further rust for the time being, but it also makes it look like the smoker is brand new! Really, take a look at your smoker now. It’s all dark, sleek and shiny looking as opposed to before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Congratulations! You have now effectively cleaned your Offset Smoker!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;default-size-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftbox-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5ff0eff52fe9a02d96335120/content_1619987648827.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;How to clean an Offset Smoker&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Now that you have wonderfully cleaned an offset smoker, here’s some questions you should be asking yourself:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How often should I clean my offset smoker?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should you clean your smoker racks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you keep a firebox from rusting?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do I need to season my smoker?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the best oil to season a smoker with?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all VERY important! Offset Smoker maintenance does not end with just a single cleaning session. There are a variety of ways to clean an offset smoker, not just including the list made above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, let’s dive deeper in to how to clean an offset smoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How often should I clean my offset smoker?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should be cleaning your offset smoker every cook. It took a long time for myself to figure this one out, but it is absolutely essential. The reasoning behind this suggestion is not to burden you with more tasks by cleaning an offset smoker, but to ensure the longevity of your cooking device. Offset smokers are a fantastic product that you want to use to cook amazing barbecue, therefore it becomes imperative to always stay up to date with your cleaning. Not only that, there are a variety of ways to make sure that your offset smoker is always cleaned. There are different types of oils, wire brushes, parts of the smoker that need more tending to, the list really goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To break it down, here’s a rule of thumb for how often offset smoker cleaning must occur:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Part of Smoker&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offset Smoker FireBox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Offset Smoker Main chamber&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Offset Smoker Main Chamber Grates&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Offset Smoker Firebox Grates&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Type of oil used&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pam Oil Spray, Vegetable Oil&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pam Oil Spray&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pam Oil Spray, Vegetable Oil&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pam Oil Spray, Vegetable Oil&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Wire brush involved&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Not always necessary&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Likelihood of Rust&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Very often&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Not often&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Not often&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Very often&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Frequency of Cleaning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Every Cook&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;When you see rust accumulation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;When you see rust accumulation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Every Cook&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a quick list of items to give you a better idea on how to manage the art of cleaning an offset smoker.

This article will be providing greater insight into the world of Brisket. It is one of the most highly coveted pieces of meat in
the barbecue realm, and I will be laying out how to smoke one.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a checklist of items used:

 *  Offset Smoker (i’ll be discussing the differences of all the types of Barbecue Pits in later blog posts)
 *  Post-Oak Wood 
 *  Thermometer 
 *  Kosher salt and Black Pepper
 *  Pink Butcher paper

THAT’S REALLY ALL IT TAKES. DON’T BELIEVE ME? TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AMAZING PIECE OF MEAT!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether you are worrying about how long it takes to smoke a brisket, what smokers to use, what temperatures to smoke a brisket on,
etc. If you follow just follow my recommended list of items that I used above, you will be well on your way to obtaining an award
winning smoked brisket, with this recipe.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOW ABOUT THE TECHNIQUE… HOW TO SMOKE AN AWARD WINNING BRISKET
When considering the technique on how to smoke the perfect brisket, only two things really count:

 1. Pull the brisket off at the right internal temp
 2. Hold the brisket a long enough time.

Those two data-points alone can make or break your cook. Seriously. I explained it briefly in my youtube video once I pulled the
brisket off the smoker, but you have to realize that brisket is a giant piece of meat. Specifically a muscle. Not only that, it
has effectively been under constant, radiant temperature for the better part of 6+ hours. Yes, it does take a long time to smoke a
brisket, and since it has been on for such a long time, the brisket is very tense and prone to losing its’ moisture. Therefore, it
becomes extremely critical to just let the thing rest!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PULL THE BRISKET OFF AT THE RIGHT INTERNAL TEMPERATURE
What does this mean? You want to make sure that when you are approaching the correct internal temperature (for brisket this is
around 200-203 degrees fahrenheit), make sure that you are probing the meat to make sure it is indeed tender throughout.
Basically, it comes down to having a probe of some sort inserted into the brisket and once it ‘comes to temp’ at around 200-203
degrees fahrenheit, you then promptly start probing around the entirety of meat to make sure that it is as tender as a stick of
butter. This is common language used among the barbecue community. You want to make sure the brisket allows you to be able to
stick something through it and have absolutely zero resistance. THAT is how you know a brisket is done.

available to do so. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOLDING THE BRISKET A LONG ENOUGH TIME!
Once you’ve gotten to the point where your brisket has gotten to the aforementioned internal temperature of 200-203 AND it is 
PROBING TENDER, you are ready to pull that bad boy.

After pulling the brisket, you have to decide where to put it. There are many different schools of thought, including just letting
it sit on your countertop, putting it in an oven, or perhaps an ice cooler. This is actually a pretty big topic which I will be
delving into in later blog posts (stay tuned!). For this cook, I opted for just placing the brisket in an oven. It makes for an
easy way to not only have it simply rest for a long enough time, but you can even begin to reheat or maintain the ambient
temperature if you so need it. As far as I know, there isn’t much of a difference in heat insulation between a cooler or an oven. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE END RESULT? AN AMAZINGLY TENDER, FALL APART BRISKET

portion of the brisket, and actually interweaves with the point, which is the fatter part. Another way to ‘verify’ if your cook
came out excellent, is to grab the leaner flat portion of the brisket and see if it ‘bends’ over your utensil or finger. It should
look exactly like it does above. Not only that you should be able to hold it at the tip and let it hang naturally, then be able to
pull it apart with ease. This will ensure that your cook is now an award winning brisket. For specifics on how to utilize the
equipment above, stay tuned.

HOW TO USE AN OFFSET SMOKER
Now that we’ve made it clear the overall technique on how to smoke an incredible brisket, we can begin to explore the
aforementioned equipment that I used. Let’s start off with one of the main pieces, the offset smoker.

If you’re wondering how to use an offset smoker, stay tuned to my blog series. I’ll be going into greater depth on all these
bolded points. There’s just so much that can go into all these different topics, it’s really exciting! 

Before getting ready to use an offset smoker for smoking a brisket, please consider the following questions:

 1. How to control smoker temp? 1. How to increase heat in smoker?
     2. Where to place water pan in offset smoker?
    
    

Controlling the offset smoker temp is another important fact that many seem to think you have to consider when smoking a brisket.
I personally am of the belief that truly award winning briskets do NOT need to be complicated. That means you DO NOT need to
constantly worry and huddle over your offset smoker to ensure a proper, and consistent flow. Do you want to make sure the fire is
burning at all times? Absolutely. HOWEVER, this can be accomplished without stressing, and should be a sigh of relief to you! Now,
in case you are wondering, here’s how to control a smoker temperature:

When you approach your offset smoker, I would strongly suggest opening all the grates. That means the main firebox where your
charcoal and wood reside, and the main grate where you will eventually place your glorious brisket. This will ensure a proper
amount of air current to not only catch the wood on fire, but to actually heat the residual metal. Once you are able to grab your
chimney starter, pour some charcoal in there and light it up. Wait roughly 10 minutes for the briquettes to light. Make sure they
are glowing red all throughout, then promptly spread them into the firebox.]]></description><link>https://bbqdropout.com/award-winning-smoked-brisket-recipes/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bbqdropout.com/award-winning-smoked-brisket-recipes/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 23:13:18 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;To get an award winning smoked brisket recipe, keep reading.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article will be providing greater insight into the world of Brisket.
